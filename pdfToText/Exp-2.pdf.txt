Objective: There are two sections in this experiment. In the first circuit Kirchoff’s Voltage Law 
(KVL) will be verified and in the second Kirchoff’s Current Law (KCL) will be verified. 
Theory: Kirchoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) in a DC circuit states that ,"the algebraic sum of the 
Voltage drop around any closed path is equal to the algebraic sum of the Voltage rises”. In other 
words, "the algebraic sum of the Voltage rises and drops around any closed path is equal to 
zero”. A plus (+) sign is assigned for the potential rises ( - to +) and minus sign (-) is assigned to 
a potential drop (+ to -). In symbolic form, Kirchoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) can be expressed as  
ΣcV=0, Where C is used for closed loop and V is used for the potential rises and drops.  
Kirchoff’s Current Law (KCL) in a DC circuit states that ," the algebraic sum of the currents 
entering and leaving an area, system or junction is zero”. In other word, "the sum of the currents 
entering an area, system or junction must be equal the sum of the currents leaving the area, 
system or junction”. In equation form, 
Σ Ientering =I leaving
