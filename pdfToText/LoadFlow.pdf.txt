Network Admittance and Impedance Matrices 
Overview 
As we have seen in Chapter 1 that a power system network can be converted into an equivalent 
impedance diagram. This diagram forms the basis of power flow (or load flow) studies and short 
circuit analysis. In this chapter we shall discuss the formation of bus admittance matrix (also 
known as Ybus matrix) and bus impedance matrix (also known as Zbus matrix). These two 
matrices are related by  
 We shall discuss the formation of the Ybus matrix first. This will be followed by the discussion of 
the formation of the Zbus matrix.

Formation of Bus Admittance Matrix  
Consider the voltage source VS with a source (series) impedance of ZS as shown in Fig. 3.1 (a). 
Using Norton's theorem this circuit can be replaced by a current source IS with a parallel 
admittance of YS as shown in Fig. 3.1 (b). The relations between the original system and the 
Norton equivalent are  
 
  
We shall use this Norton's theorem for the formulation of the Ybus matrix.

For the time being we shall assume the short line approximation for the formulation of the bus 
admittance matrix. We shall thereafter relax this assumption and use the π -representation of the 
network for power flow studies. Consider the 4-bus power system shown in Fig. 3.2. This 
contains two generators G1 and G2 that are connected through transformers T1 and T2 to buses 1 
and 2. Let us denote the synchronous reactances of G1 and G2 by XG1 and XG2 respectively and 
the leakage reactances of T1 and T2 by XT1 and XT2 respectively. Let Zij, i = 1, ..., 4 and j = 1, ... , 
4 denote the line impedance between buses i and j .  
 
Fig. 3.2 Single-line diagram of a simple power network. 
 
Then the system impedance diagram is as shown in Fig. 3.3 where Z11 = j ( XG1 + XT1 ) and Z22 = 
j ( XG2 + XT2 ).

In this figure the nodes with the node voltages of V1 to V4 indicate the buses 1 to 4 respectively. 
Bus 0 indicates the reference node that is usually the neutral of the Y-connected system. The 
impedance diagram is converted into an equivalent admittance diagram shown in Fig. 3.4. In this 
diagram Yij = 1/ Zij , i = 1,..., 4 and j = 1, ... , 4. The voltage sources EG1 and EG2 are converted 
Prepared by Tuhin Dev, Lecturer, Department of EEE Page 4 
 
into the equivalent current sources I1 and I2 respectively using the Norton's theorem discussed 
before.  
 
Fig. 3.4 Equivalent admittance diagram of the impedance of Fig. 3.3. 
We would like to determine the voltage-current relationships of the network shown in Fig. 3.4. It 
is to be noted that this relation can be written in terms of the node (bus) voltages V1 to V4 and 
injected currents I1 and I2 as follows  
 
 or, 
 It can be easily seen that we get (3.1) from (3.3) and (3.4).  
Consider node (bus) 1 that is connected to the nodes 2 and 3. Then applying KCL at this node we 
get  
 
(3.3)

In a similar way application of KCL at nodes 2, 3 and 4 results in the following equations  
 
Combining (3.5) to (3.8) we get  
 
Comparing (3.9) with (3.3) we can write  
In general the format of the Ybus matrix for an n -bus power system is as follows

where  
 It is to be noted that Ybus is a symmetric matrix in which the sum of all the elements of the k th 
column is Ykk .  
 
 
Inclusion of Line Charging Capacitors  
So far we have assumed that the transmission lines are modeled with lumped series impedances 
without the shunt capacitances. However in practice, the Ybus matrix contains the shunt 
admittances for load flow analysis in which the transmission lines are represented by its π -
equivalent. Note that whether the line is assumed to be of medium length or long length is 
irrelevant as we have seen in Chapter 2 how both of them can be represented in a p -equivalent.  
Consider now the power system of Fig. 3.2. Let us assume that all the lines are represented in an 
equivalent- π with the shunt admittance between the line i and j being denoted by Ychij . Then the 
equivalent admittance at the two end of this line will be Ychij/2. For example the shunt 
capacitance at the two ends of the line joining buses 1 and 3 will be Ych13/2. We can then modify 
the admittance diagram Fig. 3.4 as shown in Fig. 3.6. The Ybus matrix of (3.10) is then modified 
as

Elements Of The Bus Impedance And Admittance Matrices 
Equation (3.1) indicates that the bus impedance and admittance matrices are inverses of each 
other. Also since Ybus is a symmetric matrix, Zbus is also a symmetric matrix. Consider a 4-bus 
system for which the voltage-current relations are given in terms of the Ybus matrix as  
 
(3.23) 
 
(3.24) 
Prepared by Tuhin Dev, Lecturer, Department of EEE Page 8 
 
 
We can then write  
This implies that Y11 is the admittance measured at bus-1 when buses 2, 3 and 4 are short 
circuited. The admittance Y11 is defined as the self admittance at bus-1. In a similar way the self 
admittances of buses 2, 3 and 4 can also be defined that are the diagonal elements of the Ybus 
matrix. The off diagonal elements are denoted as the mutual admittances . For example the 
mutual admittance between buses 1 and 2 is defined as  
 The mutual admittance Y12 is obtained as the ratio of the current injected in bus-1 to the voltage 
of bus-2 when buses 1, 3 and 4 are short circuited. This is obtained by applying a voltage at bus-
2 while shorting the other three buses.  
The voltage-current relation can be written in terms of the Zbus matrix as  
  
  
  
The driving point impedance at bus-1 is then defined as  
 
(3.25) 
 
(3.26) 
 
(3.27) 
Prepared by Tuhin Dev, Lecturer, Department of EEE Page 9 
 
  
 i.e., the driving point impedance is obtained by injecting a current at bus-1 while keeping buses 
2, 3 and 4 open-circuited. Comparing (3.26) and (3.28) we can conclude that Z11 is not the 
reciprocal of Y11 . The transfer impedance between buses 1 and 2 can be obtained by injecting a 
current at bus-2 while open-circuiting buses 1, 3 and 4 as  
 It can also be seen that Z12 is not the reciprocal of Y12 .  
 
Load Flow Studies 
Overview 
Load flow studies are one of the most important aspects of power system planning and operation. 
The load flow gives us the sinusoidal steady state of the entire system - voltages, real and 
reactive power generated and absorbed and line losses. Since the load is a static quantity and it is 
the power that flows through transmission lines, the purists prefer to call this Power Flow 
studies rather than load flow studies. We shall however stick to the original nomenclature of 
load flow.  
Through the load flow studies we can obtain the voltage magnitudes and angles at each bus in 
the steady state. This is rather important as the magnitudes of the bus voltages are required to be 
held within a specified limit. Once the bus voltage magnitudes and their angles are computed 
using the load flow, the real and reactive power flow through each line can be computed. Also 
based on the difference between power flow in the sending and receiving ends, the losses in a 
particular line can also be computed. Furthermore, from the line flow we can also determine the 
over and under load conditions.  
The steady state power and reactive power supplied by a bus in a power network are expressed in 
terms of nonlinear algebraic equations. We therefore would require iterative methods for solving 
these equations. In this chapter we shall discuss two of the load flow methods. We shall also 
delineate how to interpret the load flow results.

Classification Of Buses 
For load flow studies it is assumed that the loads are constant and they are defined by their real 
and reactive power consumption. It is further assumed that the generator terminal voltages are 
tightly regulated and therefore are constant. The main objective of the load flow is to find the 
voltage magnitude of each bus and its angle when the powers generated and loads are pre-
specified. To facilitate this we classify the different buses of the power system shown in the chart 
below.  
 
In the next slide we'll discuss them in details. 
Load Buses : In these buses no generators are connected and hence the generated real power PGi 
and reactive power QGi are taken as zero. The load drawn by these buses are defined by real 
power -PLi and reactive power -QLi in which the negative sign accommodates for the power 
flowing out of the bus. This is why these buses are sometimes referred to as P-Q bus. The 
objective of the load flow is to find the bus voltage magnitude |Vi| and its angle δi.  
Voltage Controlled Buses : These are the buses where generators are connected. Therefore the 
power generation in such buses is controlled through a prime mover while the terminal voltage is 
controlled through the generator excitation. Keeping the input power constant through turbine-
governor control and keeping the bus voltage constant using automatic voltage regulator, we can 
specify constant PGi and | Vi | for these buses. This is why such buses are also referred to as P-V 
buses. It is to be noted that the reactive power supplied by the generator QGi depends on the 
system configuration and cannot be specified in advance. Furthermore we have to find the 
unknown angle δi of the bus voltage.  
Slack or Swing Bus : Usually this bus is numbered 1 for the load flow studies. This bus sets the 
angular reference for all the other buses. Since it is the angle difference between two voltage 
sources that dictates the real and reactive power flow between them, the particular angle of the 
slack bus is not important. However it sets the reference against which angles of all the other bus 
voltages are measured. For this reason the angle of this bus is usually chosen as 0° . Furthermore 
it is assumed that the magnitude of the voltage of this bus is known.  
Prepared by Tuhin Dev, Lecturer, Department of EEE Page 11 
 
Now consider a typical load flow problem in which all the load demands are known. Even if the 
generation matches the sum total of these demands exactly, the mismatch between generation 
and load will persist because of the line I 
2
R losses. Since the I 
2
R loss of a line depends on the 
line current which, in turn, depends on the magnitudes and angles of voltages of the two buses 
connected to the line, it is rather difficult to estimate the loss without calculating the voltages and 
angles. For this reason a generator bus is usually chosen as the slack bus without specifying its 
real power. It is assumed that the generator connected to this bus will supply the balance of the 
real power required and the line losses. 
Preparation Of Data For Load Flow 
Let real and reactive power generated at bus- i be denoted by PGi and QGi respectively. Also let 
us denote the real and reactive power consumed at the i 
th
 th bus by PLi and QLi respectively. 
Then the net real power injected in bus- i is  
  
Let the injected power calculated by the load flow program be Pi, calc . Then the mismatch 
between the actual injected and calculated values is given by  
  
In a similar way the mismatch between the reactive power injected and calculated values is given 
by  
  
The purpose of the load flow is to minimize the above two mismatches. It is to be noted that 
(4.6) and (4.7) are used for the calculation of real and reactive power in (4.9) and (4.10). 
However since the magnitudes of all the voltages and their angles are not known a priori, an 
iterative procedure must be used to estimate the bus voltages and their angles in order to 
calculate the mismatches. It is expected that mismatches ΔPi and ΔQi reduce with each iteration 
 
(4.8)

and the load flow is said to have converged when the mismatches of all the buses become less 
than a very small number.  
For the load flow studies we shall consider the system of Fig. 4.1, which has 2 generator and 3 
load buses. We define bus-1 as the slack bus while taking bus-5 as the P-V bus. Buses 2, 3 and 4 
are P-Q buses. The line impedances and the line charging admittances are given in Table 4.1. 
Based on this data the Y bus matrix is given in Table 4.2. This matrix is formed using the same 
procedure as given in Section 3.1.3. It is to be noted here that the sources and their internal 
impedances are not considered while forming the Ybus matrix for load flow studies which deal 
only with the bus voltages.

The bus voltage magnitudes, their angles, the power generated and consumed at each bus are 
given in Table 4.3. In this table some of the voltages and their angles are given in boldface 
letters. This indicates that these are initial data used for starting the load flow program. The 
power and reactive power generated at the slack bus and the reactive power generated at the P-V 
bus are unknown. Therefore each of these quantities are indicated by a dash ( - ). Since we do not 
need these quantities for our load flow calculations, their initial estimates are not required. Also 
note from Fig. 4.1 that the slack bus does not contain any load while the P-V bus 5 has a local 
load and this is indicated in the load column.

 Updating Load Bus Voltages  
 Updating P-V Bus Voltages  
 Convergence of the Algorithm  
The basic power flow equations (4.6) and (4.7) are nonlinear. In an n -bus power system, let the 
number of P-Q buses be np and the number of P-V (generator) buses be ng such that n = np + ng + 
1. Both voltage magnitudes and angles of the P-Q buses and voltage angles of the P-V buses are 
unknown making a total number of 2np + ng quantities to be determined. Amongst the known 
quantities are 2np numbers of real and reactive powers of the P-Q buses, 2ng numbers of real 
powers and voltage magnitudes of the P-V buses and voltage magnitude and angle of the slack 
bus. Therefore there are sufficient numbers of known quantities to obtain a solution of the load 
flow problem. However, it is rather difficult to obtain a set of closed form equations from (4.6) 
and (4.7). We therefore have to resort to obtain iterative solutions of the load flow problem.  
At the beginning of an iterative method, a set of values for the unknown quantities are chosen. 
These are then updated at each iteration. The process continues till errors between all the known 
and actual quantities reduce below a pre-specified value. In the Gauss-Seidel load flow we 
denote the initial voltage of the i
 th
 bus by Vi
(0)
 , i = 2, ... , n . This should read as the voltage of 
the i
 th
 bus at the 0
th
 iteration, or initial guess. Similarly this voltage after the first iteration will be 
denoted by Vi
(1)
 . In this Gauss-Seidel load flow the load buses and voltage controlled buses are 
treated differently. However in both these type of buses we use the complex power equation 
given in (4.5) for updating the voltages. Knowing the real and reactive power injected at any bus 
we can expand (4.5) as  
 
We can rewrite (4.11) as  
 In this fashion the voltages of all the buses are updated. We shall outline this procedure with the 
help of the system of Fig. 4.1, with the system data given in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. It is to be noted 
that the real and reactive powers are given respectively in MW and MVAr. However they are 
converted into per unit quantities where a base of 100 MVA is chosen.

Updating Load Bus Voltages  
Let us start the procedure with bus-2 of the 5 bus 7 line system given in fig: 4.1. Since this is 
load bus, both the real and reactive power into this bus is known. We can therefore write from 
(4.12)  
  
  
From the data given in Table 4.3 we can write  
  
  
It is to be noted that since the real and reactive power is drawn from this bus, both these 
quantities appear in the above equation with a negative sign. With the values of the Y bus 
elements given in Table 4.2 we get V2
1
 = 0.9927 < − 2.5959° .  
The first iteration voltage of bus-3 is given by  
  
  
Note that in the above equation since the update for the bus-2 voltage is already available, we 
used the 1
st
 iteration value of this rather than the initial value. Substituting the numerical data we 
get V3
(1)
 = 0.9883 < − 2. 8258° . Finally the bus-4 voltage is given by  
 
(4.13) 
 
 
 
(4.14) 
Prepared by Tuhin Dev, Lecturer, Department of EEE Page 16 
 
  
  
Solving we get V4
(1)
 = 0. 9968 < −3.4849° . 
 
Updating P-V Bus Voltages  
It can be seen from Table 4.3 that even though the real power is specified for the P-V bus-5, its 
reactive power is unknown. Therefore to update the voltage of this bus, we must first estimate 
the reactive power of this bus. Note from Fig. 4.11 that  
  
  
And hence we can write the k
th
 iteration values as  
  
  
For the system of Fig. 4.1 we have

(4.16) 
 
(4.17) 
 
(4.18)

This is computed as 0.0899 per unit. Once the reactive power is estimated, the bus-5 voltage is 
updated as  
  
  
It is to be noted that even though the power generation in bus-5 is 48 MW, there is a local load 
that is consuming half that amount. Therefore the net power injected by this bus is 24 MW and 
consequently the injected power P5, inj in this case is taken as 0.24 per unit. The voltage is 
calculated as V5
(1)
 = 1.0169 < − 0.8894° . Unfortunately however the magnitude of the voltage 
obtained above is not equal to the magnitude given in Table 4.3. We must therefore force this 
voltage magnitude to be equal to that specified. This is accomplished by  
  
  
This will fix the voltage magnitude to be 1.02 per unit while retaining the phase of − 0.8894 ° . 
The corrected voltage is used in the next iteration.  
 
Convergence of the Algorithm  
As can be seen from Table 4.3 that a total number of 4 real and 3 reactive powers are known to 
us. We must then calculate each of these from (4.6) and (4.7) using the values of the voltage 
magnitudes and their angle obtained after each iteration. The power mismatches are then 
calculated from (4.9) and (4.10). The process is assumed to have converged when each of ΔP2 , 
ΔP3, ΔP4 , ΔP5 , ΔQ2 , ΔQ3 and ΔQ4 is below a small pre-specified value. At this point the 
process is terminated.  
Sometimes to accelerate computation in the P-Q buses the voltages obtained from (4.12) is 
multiplied by a constant. The voltage update of bus- i is then given by  
 
(4.19)

where λ is a constant that is known as the acceleration factor . The value of λ has to be below 
2.0 for the convergence to occur. Table 4.4 lists the values of the bus voltages after the 1
st
 
iteration and number of iterations required for the algorithm to converge for different values of λ. 
It can be seen that the algorithm converges in the least number of iterations when λ is 1.4 and the 
maximum number of iterations are required when λ is 2. In fact the algorithm will start to 
diverge if larger values of acceleration factor are chosen. The system data after the convergence 
of the algorithm will be discussed later.
