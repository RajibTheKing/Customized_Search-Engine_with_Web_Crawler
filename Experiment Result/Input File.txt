Objective: To able to use the PowerWorld Simulator Version 17 tutorial to solve real-life 
electric power grid problems 
Materials:  
 PowerWorld Version 17 Simulator. The educational version is available as a free 
download at http://www.powerworld.com/downloads/demosoftware.asp  
 Handout ─ PowerWorld Version 17 Simulator tutorial. 
Time: 3 hours. Students have to download or take the Simulator from the class teacher and 
install it to their home computer after this class. 
Assessment: Successful construction of the power grid. 
 
PowerWorld Simulator v17 Software ─ 
1. Click on the PowerWorld Simulator icon  to start the Simulator. 
2. We are going to build a simple example of an electric power distribution grid, and let’s just 
call it a grid. Also, the software refers to grids as cases. 
3. PowerWorld v17 uses dropdown lists, which everyone is familiar with, however, because of 
the large number of features, the software also uses what are called “ribbons”. These ribbons 
take a little getting used to. 
4. To create a new case ─ 
● Select New Case from the PowerWorld Icon ─ 
 
Fig: 1: PowerWorld Icon. 
 The dropdown list  
  The screen background will turn white.

5. Inserting a bus. 
● Click on the Draw ribbon tab and find the Individual Insert ribbon group and the Network 
dropdown menu. 
 
Fig. 3: Draw, Individual Insert, and Network Ribbons and Dropdown List 
● Select Network > Bus. 
● Left-click on the background where you want to place the bus. Let’s go for upper-left. 
● When you left-click, the Bus Option Dialog appears.

Fig. 4: Bus Options. 
● Each bus needs its own number; leave this bus at (1) in the Bus Number field. 
● The Bus Name Field is where you can give Bus-1 a unique name. For this example, I’m going 
to be clever ─ name it “One”. 
● Don’t change any of the other values in the Bus Option Dialog. 
● Click on the Bus Information Tab and make sure that there is a check in the System Slack Bus 
field. Creating a Slack Bus ensures there is enough power for the system load ─ “it picks up the 
slack”. We’ll need just one of these slack bus for the entire power grid.

● Click OK and you have something like this ─ 
 
6. Inserting a generator. The bus you created needs some company. 
● Select Network > Generator from the Individual Insert ribbon on the Draw ribbon tab. 
● Left-click anywhere on bus (1), which you have just placed on the grid. 
● When you left-click, the Generator Option Dialog appears.

● Anytime you want to insert a generator, a MW (megawatt) Output must be entered so enter 413 
in the MW Output field. Leave the rest of the default settings. 
● Click on the Display Information Tab. In the Orientation field, place the generator on the bus 
─ right, up, left, or down. Select down. The Anchored checkbox “locks” the generator to the bus. 
Be sure it’s checked. Don’t change any other settings. 
 
 Fig. 7: Generator Orientation and Anchor to Bus. 
● Click OK. Your image should resemble the following ─ 
 
 Fig. 8: Single Bus and Generator. 
● If you need to make a correction, easiest way is to right click on the generator, bus, etc. When 
the drop down box appears, click on the corresponding Information Dialog and make your 
correction in the associated Options Dialog.

7. Entering a second bus. 
Since our goal is to create a min-power grid, we’re going to need more stuff. 
● Follow the same steps used to create the first bus, but let’s place this bus in the upper-right of 
the diagram. 
● When the Bus Option Dialog comes up, leave the bus number at 2 and enter “Two” in the Bus 
Name field. 
● We’re going to place a 200 MW 100 Mvar load on bus 2. To do this, click on the Attached 
Devices tab and under the Load Summary Information heading enter “200” in the Base MW field 
and “100” in the Base Mvar field.

● Click on the Bus Information Tab and make sure that the System Slack Bus field is NOT 
CHECKED. 
● Leave all the other values as is and click OK. 
● If you’re wondering where’s the load on the diagram, you haven’t done anything wrong ─ at 
least not yet. 
● To draw the load, select Network > Load from the Individual Insert ribbon group on the Draw 
ribbon tab. 
● Left-click in the center of the second bus and the Load Options Dialog will open, confirming 
the load values. 
● Select Up in the Orientation field under the Load Information tab. 
● Verify that the Anchored box is checked. 
● Click OK.

8. Inserting Transmission Lines. 
We need to start connecting the two buses. 
● Select Network > Transmission Line from the Individual Insert ribbon group on the Draw 
ribbon tab. 
● Left-click at the point where you want to start, in this case the left side of bus (1). 
● Transmission lines are drawn as a series of line segments. Without holding down the mouse 
button, drag the mouse up from bus (1). 
● Terminate the transmission line segment, by clicking the left mouse button. Each time you 
click the mouse to terminate a line segment, a new vertex is created. To draw the next line 
segment, move the mouse to the right to the desired location of the next vertex, without holding 
down the mouse button.  
● To terminate the final line segment and conclude drawing the line, double click the left mouse 
button on bus (2). The Transmission Line/Transformer Dialog appears. Verify that 1 appears in 
the From Bus Number field and a 2 appears in the to Bus Number field. 
● The Series Resistance, Series Reactance, and Shunt Charging are used to enter the information 
associated with the line. 
● Enter 0.02 in the Resistance field. 
● Enter 0.08 in the Reactance field and 0.1 in the Shunt Charging field. 
● The Limit (MVA) fields contain the MVA ratings for the line: enter a value of 1000 in the Limit 
A (MVA) field.

10. Inserting Circuit Breakers. 
The Simulator automatically inserts circuit breakers ─ 
● However, if you need to insert and additional circuit breaker, click somewhere on the line that 
you want the circuit breaker. 
● Select Indication > Circuit Breaker from the Individual Insert ribbon group on the Draw 
ribbon tab. 
● Click on the line on second time, which will cause the Circuit Breaker Options Dialog to 
appear.

11. Inserting a Transformer. 
● To insert a transformer, you need to insert an additional bus at a different voltage level. 
● Insert the new bus near the bottom of the diagram, named Three, and enter 69 KV for its 
nominal voltage. Again, click on the Bus Information Tab and make sure that the System Slack 
Bus field is NOT CHECKED. 
● Insert a transformer between buses (2) and (3) by going to Network > Transformer from the 
Individual Insert ribbon group on the Draw ribbon tab. 
● Click on bus (2), and then draw a vertical line to bus (3) as you did for a transmission line. The 
Transmission Line/Transformer Dialog automatically appears as before. 
● On the Parameters tab, enter 0.02 for Series Resistance. 
● Enter 0.08 for Series Reactance. 
● Enter 0.1 for Shunt Charging. 
● Enter 1000 for Limit A (MVA).

Fig. 18: Add or Edit Bus Load. 
● Click OK. 
● Just like in Section (7), the load on Bus (3) isn’t visible. If you need to, go back to that section 
and reread, but there is another way ─ if values (a record) already exist for that particular 
load. 
● Select Auto Insert > Loads … from the Quick Insert ribbon on the Draw ribbon tab. 
● Finally, attach a 300 MW generator to bus (3). 
● Select Network > Generator form the Individual Insert ribbon group on the Draw ribbon tab. 
● Left-click on bus (3). The Generator Option Dialog opens. 
● Select the Power and Voltage Control tab. Enter “300” in the MW Output field. 
● Click OK. Your diagram should now resemble the following ─

power flow on the transmission line and the transformers. These fields can be formatted just like 
the text fields by using the Format menu. 
● To add additional fields to a particular bus, right-click on the bus, in this case bus (1) to bring 
up the bus’ local menu. 
● Select Add New Fields Around Bus… from the local menu.
