(b) Mortar quality: Six different mix proportions 
of cement fly ash (90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 
50:50, 40:60) were used as cmentitious material. 
The mortar mixes are designated as 10%, 20%, 
30%, 40%, 50% and 60% fly ash mortar. Cement 
fly ash mix ratio of 100:0 i.e. plain cement mortar 
specimens were also cast as reference mortar for 
comparing the properties of fly ash mortars. The fly 
ash mortar means the mortar made by using cement 
and fly ash as cementitious material with sand and 
water. 
(c) Mix proportions and curing: Sand to 
cementitious material ratio of 2.75 by weight and 
water to cementittious material ratio of 0.485 were 
used in making mortar specimens for compressive 
strength and chloride ion penetration resistance test. 
Super plasticizer was incorporated in order to 
obtain mortar mixes with a similar flow of 110±5% 
in accordance with ASTM C109. The cast 
specimens were covered with polythene sheet and 
damped cloth and placed in 27±2ºC Chamber. They 
were demoulded at the age of one day and cured in 
water at 27±2ºC. 
(d) Compressive strength: The 50 mm cube 
specimens were prepared in accordance with 
ASTM C109. They were tested at the age of 3, 7, 
28, 60 and 90 days. The reported results for each 
test variables are taken as the average of three 
sample test readings. 
(e) Rapid chloride penetration resistance: The 
100 x 200 mm cylinders were prepared for chloride 
penetration resistance in accordance with ASTM 
C39. After being cured in water for the age of 27 
days, they were cut into 50 mm slices with the 50 
mm ends discarded. The 50 mm slices were epoxy-
coated around the cylindrical surface. The 100 mm 
dia. x 50 mm epoxy-coated specimens were tested 
at the age of 28 days for rapid chloride penetration 
test (RCPT) in accordance with the method 
described in ASTM C1202. The reported results are 
taken as the average of three samples. The test 
setup for determination of chloride ion penetration 
resistance is shown in Fig.1 to 4. The ASTM 
guidelines concerning the chloride ion penetrability 
are given in Table-3.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  
Various types of specimens made from different 
proportion of OPC and fly ash mortar were exposed 
to plain water to determine compressive strength 
and resistance to chloride ion penetration for 
various exposure periods. OPC mortar is considered 
as datum and used to compare the effect of fly ash 
in strength gaining and against chloride ion 
penetration. 
 
3.1. Compressive Strength 
The compressive strength of OPC and fly ash 
mortars as listed in Table-4, has been graphically 
represented in Fig.5. Also for the ease of 
comparison, the relative compressive strengths are 
plotted in Fig.6. Among all the mixes, for 3 days 
and 7 days compressive strength, no fly ash mortar 
achieves as much strength as that of OPC mortar. 
Test results showed that the 3 days compressive 
strength for OPC mortar is 9%, 15%, 23%, 29%, 
45% and 59% higher than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 
50% and 60% fly ash mortar respectively. Up to 
curing period of 7 days, compressive strength is 
seen to decrease with the increase in fly ash content 
when compared with no fly ash mortar. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
28 days compressive strength of the specimens up 
to 50% replacement level was reported to be similar 
with OPC mortar strength. Compressive strength 
are slightly lower by 3%,1%, 1% and 9% for fly 
ash mortar of cement fly ash ratio 90:10, 80:20, 
50:50 and 40:60 respectively when compared with 
OPC mortar. 28 days strength for the 30% and 40% 
fly ash mortar was observed to be 2% and 4% 
higher when compared with no fly ash mortar. 
60 days compressive strength data obtained for 
10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% fly ash mortar were 
respectively 5%, 9%, 11%, 15% and 7% higher 
than no fly ash mortar, whereas 60% fly ash mortar 
strength was lower than OPC mortar by 7%. After 
90 days, maximum compressive strength was 
obtained for 30% and 40% fly ash mortar 
specimens with an increase in strength of 13% and 
16% respectively as compared to OPC mortar. Also 
10%, 20% and 50% replacement level provided an 
increase in strength of 7%, 10% and 9% 
respectively as compared with no fly ash mortar. 
Cement normally gains its maximum strength 
within 28 days. During that period, lime produced 
form cement hydration remains within the 
hydration product. Generally, this lime reacts with 
fly ash and imparts more strength. For this reason, 
mortar made with fly ash will have almost same 
strength as that of OPC mortar up to 28 days and 
substantially higher strength within 90 days. Fly 
ash retards the hydration of C3S in the early stages 
but accelerates it at later stages (Jawed and Skalny, 
1981). Conversely in cement mortar, this lime 
would remain intact and with time it would be 
susceptible to the effects of weathering and loss of 
strength and durability. Yamato and Sugita (1983) 
found that the later age strength of fly ash concrete 
was higher than that of the control concrete and that 
the modulus of elasticity was comparable to that of 
concrete made with moderate heat Portland cement.

3.2. Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration 
Chloride ion penetration resistance value for OPC 
and fly ash mortar cured for 28 days period are 
shown in Table-5 as well as graphically presented 
in Fig.7.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of OPC mortar, amount of passing charge is 
6900 coulombs whereas the similar value for fly 
ash mortars are 4300, 3900, 3400, 2700, 2300 and 
2000 coulombs for 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 
60% fly ash mortars respectively. The incorporation 
of pozzolanic materials improves the resistance to 
chloride penetration of mortar as confirmed by 
other researchers (Janotka and Krajci, 2000). A 
close observation of the data shows that fly ash 
mortar has relatively better resistance against 
chloride ion penetration. Fly ash has high fineness 
and can react with the products liberated during 
hydration. It forms secondary C-S-H gel that fills 
all the pores inside concrete and makes it more 
impermeable (Yalbot et. al., 1995). So it reduces 
the amount of charge passed thorough the concrete. 
Experimental result shows that as the amount of fly 
ash used in mortar is increased, charge flow 
through the mortar sample is decreased. This is due 
to the reduction of the pore spaces inside the mortar 
specimen that makes the mortar dense and compact 
and as a result the amount of charge flow is 
decreased. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall observation shows that after 90 days curing 
compressive strength values obtained for 20%, 
30%, 40% and 50%  fly ash mortar were 10%, 
13%, 16% and 9% higher than OPC mortar 
respectively, whereas chloride penetration 
resistance is 43%, 51%, 61% and 67% higher as 
compared to OPC mortar. From both strength and 
chloride penetration resistance point of view, these 
four types of mortar are comparable. Among them 
20%, 30% and 40% fly ash mortar are better from 
strength consideration. Again from the three mortar 
mix 40% fly ash mortar has better resistance 
against chloride ion penetration. Also all the values 
lie in the moderate range as per ASTM guidelines. 
60% fly ash mortar shows best result against 
chloride ion penetration which is 71% better as 
compared to OPC mortar but strength is 6% lower 
as compared to OPC mortar. So this mortar is not 
good form strength point of view. After analyzing 
all the experimental result, it may be concluded that 
40% fly ash mortar is best from durability as well 
as strength point of view.

4. CONCLUSION 
 
Based on limited number of test variables studied 
and the results of the investigation conducted on 
different types of mortars, the following 
conclusions are drawn. 
 
(1) The rate of gain in strength of fly ash mortar 
specimens is observed to be lower than the 
corresponding OPC mortar at early ages of curing. 
(2) Fly ash mortar mix having various cement 
replacement level up to 50% exhibited satisfactory 
results for both compressive strength and chloride 
ion penetration resistance.  
(3) Fly ash blended mortar of replacement level 
40% to 60% exhibited moderate penetrability to 
chloride ions diffusion as per ASTM guideline, 
whereas OPC mortar falls within the high range of 
chloride penetrability.  
(4) From both strength and chloride resistance 
consideration, the optimum fly ash content is 
observed to be 40% of cement. After 90 days 
curing, fly ash mortars with 40% cement 
replacement shows around 16% higher compressive 
strength compared to OPC mortar. Also, it shows 
around 51% higher resistance against chloride ion 
penetration.   
(5) In addition to lower chloride penetrability, use 
of fly ash as a partial replacement of cement in any 
construction work, provides lower impact on 
environment (reduce CO2 emission) and judicious 
use of resources (energy conservation, use of by-
product)

ABSTRACT 
Eco-sanitation technology has been implemented in various part of the world, including both developed and 
developing countries as a sustainable sanitation option. Eco sanitation is good for environment, inexpensive 
and provides the only sustainable solutions available to problems of water shortage and sanitation problems. 
Eco toilet as a sustainable option can play an important rule to human waste disposal, retrieve and reuse the 
nutrients from human waste, and reduces use of water. Recycling of human excreta as fertilizer is the main 
reason to be appreciated by the users. Eco-toilet is new to Bangladesh. Some of NGOs implemented eco 
toilet in some areas of the country. This study focuses on the challenges and opportunities of eco toilet 
installation. In Sylhet city a huge number of slum people exist. Due to lack of fund and people awareness 
eco toilet are becoming very difficult to install. People have very short opportunity to use the fertilizers 
produced from the eco toilet by them. People have also superstition in having the vegetable produced by 
using the fertilizers from eco toilet.  A family of 5 members produces the waste which has a value of BDT 
5292.5. If government and other nongovernmental organization come forward the challenges can be 
removed.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Sylhet is a tea producing area of Bangladesh 
situated in north eastern part of the country, where 
a huge amount of migrated people live in slums [1]. 
Open defecation is a very common practice in the 
slums. Children practice open defecation more than 
adults. In maximum number of slums there are 
unhealthy sanitary latrines and proper disposal 
facilities. About 70% children in slums practice 
open defecation. It is evident that about 27.8% slum 
people practices open defecation in average and 
about 39% slum people uses unsanitary latrine and 
27% uses low cost sanitary latrines. Only 6.2% 
people have paka (RCC structure) latrines available 
to use [3].  
Eco-sanitation is a new way of looking at 
sanitation.  It treats human waste as a resource, and 
seeks to reintegrate sanitation with agriculture in a 
safe way, in order to reduce disease and improve 
low-income farmers’ access to high-quality 
fertilizer [2].  It also looks at reducing waste of 
water, recharging ground water, and ensuring that 
people’s need for water is met in a sustainable 
manner.

Eco-sanitation offers important solutions to many 
of the pressing and related problems of water and 
sanitation. Eco-sanitation involves extensive 
systems with multiple components. It can include 
systems for rainwater collection and use. It can

involve reuse of grey water (the water from sinks 
and showers that otherwise goes down drains) to 
flush toilets or water plants or for agriculture. It can 
involve separation and composting of human waste 
in such a way as to benefit agriculture by providing 
needed fertilizer while also increasing access to 
clean and odor-free toilets for the poor. Eco toilet is 
a helpful tool for eco- friendly sanitation practice. It 
is designed to establish a way of sanitation practice 
which will enable fair waste management through 
collection and recycling. In an eco-toilet the human 
feces, urines and water used in latrine are collected 
separately. The basic function of eco toilet is 
collecting human feces as a dry waste. To do so eco 
toilet contains a heat panel. Figure 2 shows the 
internal model of eco toilet.

Benefits of eco toilet: 
Eco toilet is environmental friendly and it provides 
so many facilities to manage the human excreta in a 
sustainable ways such as- 
• It reduces water pollution; indirectly 
prevent the water born diseases which 
exist in Bangladesh at a huge rate. 
• Since eco toilet needs no flushing water 
hence it reduces the consumption of water. 
• In Bangladesh and many other agricultural 
country scarcity of fertilizer hampers 
agricultural production. By using eco toilet 
big amount of fertilizer can be produce, 
which is environment friendly. 
• The life cycle of human excreta in the eco 
toilet system starts from the people and 
ends to the people, which maintain the 
ecological balance. Figure 2 shows the 
cycle involved in disposing of human 
excreta through eco toilet. 
• In eco toilet system there is no smell 
problem, no fly nuisance and no insect 
breeding. 
• Young children can use it safely. 
• Poor people can be free of the scarcity of 
fertilizer. 
• Reduce the rate of diseases suffered by the 
people. 
Cost of installation & price of recycled products: 
In installation of an eco toilet the involved costs are  
• Land cost 
• Construction cost 
• Cost of ash 
Cost of ash and the land is not considered in this 
study. The main cost is the construction cost is 
about BDT 12500-1500. In a family of 5 members 
the total solid component from urine and feces is 
about 529.25 kg. The price of the waste is about 
BDT 5292.5; assuming the price of the fertilizer is 
about BDT 10. Additionally, the water 
consumption is reduced by 5475 liters/year in eco 
toilet practice by a family of 5 members.

Challenges: 
The main challenges to introduce the eco toilet are 
• Cost 
• Low awareness level 
• Proper maintenance 
Most of the people become interested in seeing the 
opportunity of eco toilet. But due to lack of funds 
they cannot take the steps to introduce it. In 
Bangladesh the open defecation and unsanitary 
sanitation practice is common among the low 
income people. They are even not educated and 
aware. To ensure the effective practice of eco toilet 
training is essential to teach the maintenance 
procedure of eco toilet. 
To overcome the challenges of the eco toilet 
installation and practice the parties which can be 
very effective are as follows- 
• Local organizations and NGOs. 
• Government and official bodies. 
• Commercial and private sectors.

• Professional association and bodies.
2. METHODOLOGY 
 
This study has done mainly to assess 
and opportunities to introduce the eco
sustainable sanitation option to the low income 
people. For this reason 6 slums were selected from 
the different area of Sylhet city. Two slums were 
selected from village area (Mirerchar, Kamal 
Bazar); two were selected from town 
Subhanighat) and two from tea garden area
(Malnicherra, Lakkatura).  
 
 
 
 
Relevant data from each zone were collected that 
included socio-economic conditions of the slum 
dwellers, rate of people have problem in installing 
toilet, access to quantity and quality of water, 
access to basic sanitation services and sanitation 
behavior of the people. The awareness level and 
educational attainment of the people were also 
taken into account. Several approaches to data 
collection were used that included household 
survey, key informants’ interviews and case 
studies.  
 
3. RESULT  
 
In case of eco toilet installation in the place of 
existing toilet an initial investment is needed. Since 
the slum people are very low income people hence 
they cannot provide the fund for establishing eco 
toilet. Figure-1 shows the rate of people considered 
they have economic problem to install the eco 
toilet. It is found that in Z-4 89.5% people have 
economic problem to introduce the eco toilet.

The slum people are not educated enough and they 
have very low level of awareness and knowledge 
about eco toilet practice. It is determined that in Z
13% people are aware and in Z-6 only 5.4% people 
are aware about the eco toilet practice and its 
benefits.Figure-3 shows the rate of people aware 
about the eco toilet. Mentionable there have few 
program undertaken to increase the awareness level 
of the people of the study area. 
 
 
Figure 3: Rate of awareness of the people.
The slums in the village area have more 
opportunity to use the produced fertilizer from the 
eco toilet than the slums in town area. Thi
because the village slums have more open place for 
farming than town slums. In Z-1 and Z
and 6% people have this opportunity respectively. 
In Z-4 27% people have this opportunity. In Z
and Z-6 above 40% people have opportunity to use 
the fertilizers by themselves. Figure 4 shows the 
rate people have opportunity to use the fertilizer by 
themselves.

In Z-5 and Z-6 above 37% people are motivated to 
the eco toilet.  Figure 5 shows the rate of people

As we know that the slum peoples are not educated 
enough they have superstition in having the 
vegetables produced by using the fertilizers from 
eco toilet. The superstition is high in case of village 
slum and tea garden slum people. In Z
people disagree to have the vegetable and in Z
47.1 % people have disagreed to have these 
vegetables.

4. CONCLUSION  
Installation of eco toilet is very much challenging 
in case of low income people. It is shown that the 
low income people are not able to provide the fund 
needed for the eco toilet installation. They are not 
aware also. But there have many mentionable 
benefits of eco toilet. To install the eco toilet the 
following steps are recommended- 
• Government organization should provide 
the funds and organize programs to 
increase the awareness and knowledge of 
the people. 
• Micro credit can be provided for the eco 
toilet installation. 
• Scientific explanation about the healthy 
consumption of the vegetable produced by 
the fertilizers from the eco toilet needed to 
be established and communicated. 
• Benefits of eco toilet should be 
communicated with mass people.  
• The produced fertilizers can be 
manufactured and lunched at the market.

Due to the climate change and consequent sea level rise (SLR), extreme environmental phenomenons are 
presumed to occur more frequently and more intensely in Bangladesh. It is feared that this will result in huge 
population exodus. Dhaka being the capital city and most desired destination for most migrants (Climate 
Refugees-CR), will put great pressure on it. Dhaka is already burdened with many problems including; 
overcrowding, environmental degradation, lack of infrastructure and services, poor governance etc. and has 
limited physical and managerial capacity to cope with such problems and the CRs would be an added 
pressure on it. The objective of his paper is discuss SLR scenario and explore for a range of adaptive 
measures to respond to SLR induced situation. It is believed that the proposed measures will prevent large 
scale migrations and Dhaka would be saved from further deterioration due to CR induced overcrowding 
whilst helping them to avoid the misery of urban life in the slums of Dhaka.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The global climate is changing due to both 
anthropogenic and natural process. The United 
Nations Development Programme reiterates that the 
scientific evidence supporting climate change is 
clear and that climate change is now a reality 
(UNDP, 2007/2008). In its 2007 report, the UN 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1 
(IPCC) provides convincing evidence of the 
ongoing processes of climate change and the 
contributing factors. 
The impact of climate change is vast and complex. 
One of the significant impacts is the increased 
population displacements. The IPCC (2007) report 
estimated that by 2050, 150 million people could be 
displaced by climate change related phenomenon. 
Bangladesh, with its low-lying deltaic environment, 
will be severely affected by the climate change. 
According to UNDP (2010), by the year 2050, 
Bangladesh could loose 18 % of its land due to 
rising sea levels (SLR), resulting in 30 million 
                                               
1 The intergovernmental PANEL ON Climate Change (IPCC) 
formed in 1988 is a scientific intergovernmental body tasked 
with evaluating the risk of climate change caused by human 
activity.  The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.  
displaced people or climate refugees (CR). The 
displacement of people to new and existing 
settlements will put additional pressure on 
infrastructure and other services (IPCC, 2007). 
Factors like resources to move, livelihoods and 
social networks are regarded as the cause of 
migration. For social networking and secured 
livelihood reasons, options to migrate to Dhaka are 
most probable for CRs (Sirajee, 2010). 
Dhaka is already burdened by many problems such 
as overpopulation, unplanned and inadequate 
services and infrastructure, poor governance, severe 
traffic congestion and environmental degradation. 
Additionally, when migrants end up invariably in 
the slums of Dhaka, the situation will further 
worsen. According to Begum (1999) more than 
90% of migrants admitted to being influenced by 
the capital city status of Dhaka and nearly two 
thirds had over-estimated the facilities available in 
Dhaka. As a result, Dhaka has become long 
established and ultimate destination for most 
internal migrants, whether they are CRs or not 
(Courier, 2009). “Migrants to the city of Dhaka are 
not all single minded individuals who possess 
transferable skills; many tend to be illiterate, 
unskilled, old, and ill equipped for the city” 
(Begum,1999,p4). As such, migration to Dhaka

ISBN: 978-984-33-2140-4
  
places an additional burden to already fragile urban 
infrastructure and population. 
 
2. STUDY FRAMEWORK 
 
2.1. Study Issues:  
The paper aims to see various scenarios of adaptive 
measures to accommodate the CRs. Research on 
SLR, CR and adaptation measures in the human 
settlement is almost non-existent. Courier (2009) 
thinks that enough reliable, holistic research simply 
doesn't exist on CRs. It can be suggested that a 
planned migration process can be undertaken which 
could be proposed under the scope of National level 
and Regional level adaptive measures. These need 
to be undertaken in a process where first option is 
to retain people within the effected areas and the 2nd 
option could be to encourage them to move to 
regional cities and gradually to bigger cities. This 
paper is concerned with the first option ie, retaining 
people in their place through local level adaptive 
measures.  
2.2. Understanding the Context:  
Climate change refers to a change of climate that is 
caused by human activity directly or indirectly, 
thus resulting in change in global atmosphere in 
addition to that climate variability observed over 
comparable time periods (IPCC, 2007). As early as 
1990 the IPCC also noted that “The greatest single 
impact of climate change might be on human 
migration - with millions of people displaced by 
shoreline erosion, coastal flooding and agricultural 
disruption”. Salehyan (2005) stated - 
“Environmental pressures have shaped human 
migration and settlement patterns for the 
millennia”. In general, the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) proposes the 
following definition of such migrants. 
“Environmental migrants are persons or 
groups of persons, who, for compelling 
reasons of sudden or progressive changes in 
the environment that adversely affect their 
lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave 
their habitual homes, or chose to do so, either 
temporarily or permanently, and who move 
either within their country or 
abroad”.(IOM,2008,p1-2) 
The problems generated from CR induced ethnic 
tension, distrust and other conditions may de-
stabilize host areas. “Conflict may erupt in 
receiving areas in response to competition, as CRs 
may burden the economic and resource base of the 
receiving area and competing for the resources.” 
(Mowla &Zareen, 2005; Mowla, 2008). Often 
conflict in some cases may erupt due to resource 
scarcity and competition and this conflict can lead 
to greater migration. (Salehyan,2005). Dhaka being 
already burdened with social tension is extremely 
susceptible to such conflict.  
 
3. CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
CLIMATE REFUGEE NEXUS IN 
BANGLADESH CONTEXT 
 
The victims of climate change may be affected by 
four different phenomenon such as Deluge of a 
large part of the country; Intrusion of Salinity; 
Destabilization of rivers; Increase in extreme 
weather event (Islam, S. 2010). All such 
phenomenon is already contributing to the cause of 
CRs to Dhaka of both temporary and permanent 
type (Shafi, 2010). Severe conditions already 
prevail in Southern part of Bangladesh and will 
continue hitting the area more frequently in near 
future. Drought will also have some impact on the 
western part of the country. Flood will have adverse 
impact especially on the Gangetic plain. At present 
CRs gets displaced from these regions. 
Adaptation can be defined as a method of 
adjustment or coping mechanism with its 
surrounding that helps improve the quality of life 
under strenuous circumstances (Mowla & Zereen, 
2005). The proposed adaptive measures at the local 
level will mostly fall under the category of: 
a) Shared losses (providing subsidies to people), 
b) Modifying the threat (e.g. switching to alternate 
means and pattern etc), 
c) Preventing the impact (Building of protective 
infrastructure etc.), 
d) Change use (livelihood change etc.) etc. (Ahmed 
at el., 1999).  
The planned measures will bolster the performance 
of spontaneous adaptive measure which the people 
of Bangladesh have practiced and developed over 
centuries. According to Ahmed et al (1999) 
“Adaptation at the micro (local) level often takes 
place spontaneously. People at grassroots often 
adjust to a given situation on a short term basis and 
as such; adaptation often follows the cycle of act-
learn-act”. If liveability can be increased at the 
effected level, migration can be brought under 
control (Mowla, 2000&2005). People participation 
and feedback is a necessary component to enhance 
the performance of adaptive measure at local level.  
3.1 Shared losses  
3.1.1 Subsidy: If people are provided with grants, 
soft loans and other form of financial help during 
the time of dire need, it is assumed that they will 
deter from migrating. It is an accepted notion that 
most people tend to fight back (Mowla,2000) and 
this spirit can be enhanced by financial support. As 
Page 96
  
Kulsum (2010) states “It is proved that coastal 
vulnerable communities are positive to adapt 
themselves to changing environment but the major 
challenges are their limited financial resources.”  
3.1.2 Insurance: Insurance against climatic events 
is expected to help people to retain life after 
devastation. According to the UNFCCC (2008) 
Convention (Article 4.8), insurance related actions 
constitute one of the three main means of response 
to the adverse effects of climate change, alongside 
funding and technology transfer. UNFCCC (2008) 
opines, “[insurance] can enhance financial 
resilience to external shocks and provide a unique 
opportunity to spread and transfer risk’. For private 
enterprise, such measure could be a challenge and 
opportunity at the same time. It is expected that 
insurance related to housing will reduce CRs 
significantly. 
3.1.3 Disaster Relief Management: Through 
proper disaster relief and recovery management CR 
could be reduced. Depending on the nature and 
scale of climate change, these type of management 
continue from several month to several year. 
Government, N.G.O (Non Govt. Organisation) and 
C.B.O (Community Based Organisation) could play 
a pivotal role in such operations. 
3.2. Modifying the Threat 
Such measures require a comprehensive 
environmental rehabilitation approach linked to 
agriculture fisheries and livestock, as these sectors 
provide bulk of food required (Ketel,2008). Proper 
water harvesting will also lessen displacement and 
increase liveability in the effected areas.  
3.2.1 Agriculture: Adaptation of agriculture 
systems in SLR areas can increase food security. In 
this context, floating agriculture in the water logged 
area could be a solution. Diversification of 
agriculture and change in crop calendar, use of 
paddy fields with irrigation and mulching/green 
manuring, change of fertiliser use and application 
can be implemented. For salinity intrusion, saline 
tolerant crop varieties could be introduced (Islam, 
S. 2010). Major problems of rice production relate 
to different kinds of stresses such as abiotic stress 
(submergence, salinity intrusion, drought, low/cold 
temp, high temp, and soil fertility), biotic stress 
(disease, insect, and weed) and socio-economic 
stress (Islam,2010). Such stress resistant rice should 
be cultivated in local area prone to extreme climatic 
events to solve food shortage. In the field of 
agriculture, scientists have already succeeded in 
developing many varieties suitable for particular 
agro-ecological zones (Ahmed et al, 1999).  
3.2.2 Water Resources Management: Fresh Water 
is an essential element in retaining people within 
area. In this context protection of water catchment 
areas and ground water, rainwater harvesting and 
desalination is important at the local level. Water 
policy reform including pricing and irrigation 
policies can be developed at national level to 
address the problem of water at local level 
(UNFCCC,2008). The heavy seasonal rain fall in 
Bangladesh makes rainwater harvesting a possible 
option for storage of drinking water. Due to 
unfavourable geo-physical condition of coastal 
areas some people have already been practicing this 
for storage of water. This may be further improved.    
3.3. Preventing the Impact 
Ketel (2008) suggests that with a better 
understanding of what causes displacement, pre 
emptive measures can be applied which will help 
people overcome their difficulties at an early stage, 
thereby enabling them to remain in their home area. 
Such activities occur in the pre-disaster phase, and 
include among others preparedness and mitigation 
in the following ways (Shaw, K, 2009):  
3.3.1 Structural:  
i. Infrastructure: The Construction of roads, Water 
retention ponds, culvert, embankment  improves 
communication and at the same time protect area 
from natural disaster that devastate houses and 
render people homeless. Infrastructures like 
cyclone shelter, flood shelter also provides refuge 
during the extreme weather event. 
ii. Housing: People mainly migrate due to 
homelessness. House and settlement pattern may 
need modification to better cope with the changing 
conditions and reduce homelessness. Roofs should 
be properly designed and tied with base or main 
structure (Kulsum,2010). Flood and cyclone 
responsive shelter may be built in the worst 
affected areas.  
iii. Renewable Energy: The provision of alternate 
energy will increase liveability, enabling villagers 
to use it for productive and social activities. 
Renewable energy is sustainable and enhances 
liveability (Mowla, 2007 & 2008). With an increase 
in liveability it is expected that the tendency of 
people to migrate will decrease. Alternate energy 
sources could be Solar, wind, bio-gas etc. 
3.3.2 Non Structural:  
i. Forestry, Natural Resources and Terrestrial 
Ecosystem: Reduction of climate change hazards 
through coastal afforestation with community 
participation is a priority issue (Mowla, 2000). 
Coastal mangrove afforestation, tall trees next to 
tidal free zone, bamboo and cane cultivation as 
windbreaker, cultivation of horticulture species, 
agro forestry, and coast specific wood trees are also 
required to combat climatic events (Islam,S. 2010). 
Page 97
  
Besides material from trees such as thatch, leaves, 
woods will help people to undertake alternate 
livelihood after disaster. Other anticipatory 
adaptive measure like creation of parks/reserves, 
protected areas and biodiversity corridors, 
Identification / development of species resistant to 
climate change, better assessment of the 
vulnerability of ecosystems, monitoring of species, 
development and maintenance of seed banks etc 
need to be adopted (UNFCCC,2008). All these 
measure will enhance environmental performance 
that will motivate people to stay in their own area 
instead of migrating. 
ii. Health: Due to climate change events, there will 
be a propensity of post traumatic stress and other 
sort of psychological and physical stress. In the 
absence of proper health support many people 
would migrate from affected areas. Reactive health 
measure such as emergency response and 
anticipatory adaptive measures such as better and 
/or improved disease/vector surveillance should be 
undertaken to help victims of climatic events 
(UNFCCC,2008). 
3.3.3 Community Based Adaptation:  
i. Motivation: Community level motivation 
programme could be more effective in combating 
climate change impacts (Maarten, van Aalst, 2008). 
Community-level adaptation strategies and 
implementation management plans like excavation 
to reduce water logging, raising of embankment to 
prevent intrusion of saline tidal water; pond sand-
filter for safe drinking water, construction of new 
multipurpose cyclone shelters etc. to reinforce 
liveability in rural area (Islam, A. 2010) may be 
developed and implemented. This type of 
community level adaptation strategy will enhance 
community feeling and sense of belonging to the 
local area and will deter people from migrating 
because of such feeling and support. The local 
community’s views and experience on climate 
change impact, adaptation through programmes like 
community consultation, group meeting, youth 
group activation and capacity building, the idea of 
out- migration can be stalled.   
ii. Public Awareness: Through public awareness 
and dissemination of ideas related to grim future of 
Dhaka bound migration, a major breakthrough can 
be achieved. Improving public awareness and 
developing overall communications strategies at 
local level could make information related to 
climate change induced migration available to the 
average citizen and can reduce out migration 
(UNFCCC, 2008). 
iii. Knowledge Base Education: Inclusion of 
climate change related issues in the curriculum 
could discourage people to migrate out particularly 
to Dhaka. Knowledge should be made available as 
such and shared at the local level facing difficulties 
that leads migration towards Dhaka. In support to 
this initiative, there is a need to establish 
mechanisms for accessing and analysing current 
knowledge on migration and address priority gaps 
in current knowledge (Ahmed et al,1999). 
3.4. Change Use 
3.4.1 Fisheries: Adaptation of fisheries in areas 
prone to enhanced flooding in North East and 
Central Regions through adaptive and diversified 
fish culture practice can increase food security. 
Promoting adaptation to coastal fisheries through 
culture of salt tolerant fish especially in the coastal 
areas of Bangladesh will help increase liveability 
by increasing livelihood and food security. 
(Islam,A.2010) 
3.4.2 Livelihood diversification: Livelihood 
diversification is essential element to adaptive 
resilience to climatic disasters. When people loose 
their livelihood from agriculture and fisheries, 
alternative livelihood provides them a means to 
survive within their area. The alternative 
livelihoods supplementary to their main livelihoods 
can be crab fattening, livestock raring and non-farm 
activities. The non farm activities may include 
cottage industry such as weaving, articles, baskets 
and mat making from bamboo, local reed variety 
(Kulsum, 2010). All these will help local people 
resort to a new life instead of migrating to Dhaka. 
 
4. DISCUSSION AND  
RECOMMENDATION  
 
4.1. Discussion:  
The concept of anthropogenic (human induced) 
climate change migration is relatively new as the 
phenomenon started to appear since industrial 
revolution with the emission of GHG (Green House 
Gas) mainly by industrial activities.  Globally, CR 
surfaced with the inception of IPCC in 1988. As 
Haq (2007, p11) opines, “Climate change is a fairly 
new issue and that adaptation is even younger. We 
are learning by doing”.   
The mitigation measures for CR’s towards Dhaka at 
the root level are  subsidy, insurance, disaster relief 
management, innovative agriculture, water resource 
harvesting, building infrastructure, building houses, 
enhancing natural resources, improving health, 
community base adaptation, raising public 
awareness etc as discussed. The priority issues in 
implementing such solutions are funding, 
development of a knowledge base, capacity 
building, public awareness and finally Government 
commitment and will. To develop a knowledge 
base and capacity building with civil society, 
Page 98
  
universities, NGOs and other international and 
national body can contribute significantly. 
Ultimately it is the government with community 
support who should initiate and monitor all 
activities.  
The constraints of implementing the adaptive 
measures at local level are huge and pose a major 
challenge.  In terms of funding, it  will be difficult 
to arrange extensive funds from Government’s own 
resource, when the government  is  grappling with 
the problems like poverty, high unemployment, low 
literacy rate, insufficient  basic health care issues 
for people of Bangladesh. The chance of obtaining 
substantial funds from foreign sources appears 
remote which was evident from last global 
conference on climate change in Copenhagen. 
Limited institutional capacity, limited technical 
capacity is also major deterrents for smooth 
operation of such adaptive measures. Moreover 
corruption and extreme level of politicization of 
administration are also a major deterrent from 
implementing such adaptive measures. Despite all 
constraints, Government has initiated some sign in 
positive direction by formulating Climate Change 
Strategy and Action Plan and National Adaptation 
Program of Action (NAPA).  
The successful implementation of adaptive 
measures at the local level will increase the 
liveability in those areas and will contribute 
significantly in reducing out migration. Each of the 
proposed adaptive measures at the local level 
should be regarded as ‘guideline solution’. People 
are responding well in the hostile climatic effect 
situations (like Sidr, Aila, or Beel Dakatia), their 
experience may be shared in the SLR and CR 
management. More research should be initiated on 
each of the adaptive measure by specialists and 
related experts.  
4.2 Recommendations 
1. A National Policy (Bangladesh) should be 
formulated addressing environmental 
migrant (CR) issues. 
2. National Policies (Bangladesh) need be 
formulated related to adaptive measures at 
different level (local, regional and national) 
to minimize migrant flow to Dhaka. 
3. A separate fund should be allocated from 
‘Climate Change Fund’ for the specific 
purpose to address adaptive measures to 
minimize migrant flow to urban areas like 
Dhaka. 
4. NGOs and CBOs and international agencies 
should be given enough support and freedom 
from all levels of administration to undertake 
and facilitate these adaptive measures. 
5. Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 
and National Adaptation Program of Action 
(NAPA) should be revised in order to 
provide more importance and significance to 
issues related to environmental migrants 
(CR) issue, specifically migrants to Dhaka. 
6. As environmental migrants are innocent 
victim of situation caused by GHG emission 
mainly by developed nations, a ‘Multi-Donor 
Trust Fund' need to be formulated 
comprising compensation from foreign 
countries. 
7. Slum policy for Dhaka should be formulated 
in order to ameliorate the suffering of slum 
dwellers, which is the ultimate abode of such 
environmental rural migrants. 
8. Climate change migration issue should be 
included in the curriculum at secondary and 
tertiary educational institution, discouraging 
people to migrate out especially to Dhaka. 
9. National media should provide due coverage 
underscoring the need to retain 
environmentally affected people within local 
area or migrate to regional growth centres 
instead of migrating to Dhaka. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 
In implementing such adaptive measures local 
government need collaboration with National level 
administration. In addition, local government 
administration with the help of NGO (Non 
Government Organization), CBO (Community 
Based Organisations) and people’s representatives 
can develop programs for implementing such 
adaptive measures. NGOs and CBOs should be 
given enough support and freedom from all levels 
of administration to undertake and facilitate these 
adaptive measures. 
IOM’s (International Organisation of Migration) 
policy and notion in general opposes migration 
towards urban areas and thinks migration hinders 
development in at least four ways; by increasing 
pressure on urban infrastructure and services, by 
undermining economic growth, by increasing the 
risk of conflict and by leading to worsening health, 
educational and social indicators among migrants 
themselves. (IOM, 2008). It can be argued that 
local level adaptive measure would not only reduce 
migration to Dhaka but also to other cities.   
In nutshell, the climate change induced migration 
should be given due priority and importance 
nationally as a major new field of inquiry. As Ketel 
(2008) suggests, human migration caused by 
climate change might well be one of the major 
development problems of the third millennium. As 
such, utmost importance should be provided from 
Page 99
  
the part of governments and international 
humanitarian, development, and environmental 
agencies to this pressing issue.

Dhaka has grown from a small settlement to a sprawling metropolis of about fifteen million people. 
Traditional physical development in this region offered the best and integrated solutions towards human 
needs, in their relation with the nature and the community but contemporary development has ignored living 
with nature. Studies show that much greater environmental as well as socio-economic advantages can be 
achieved through design with ecological principles in mind than without it. This paper aims at understanding 
the development trend in Dhaka, the crises it is facing and the possible strategies to overcome the problem. It 
is concluded that fragmented approach of planning must be avoided and that the development taking care of 
geomorphology and hydrological behaviour of the place would result in a sustainable environment.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Dhaka is located in the midst of an active delta – 
the largest in the world. Siltation process is going 
on for ages in both water channels as well as in the 
flood plains thereby their relative depth remains 
almost constant and the shore line moves south 
ward with the accretion of new lands. In his 
context, Dhaka has grown from a small trading 
settlement to a sprawling metropolis of about 
fifteen million people. The spatial development 
followed the prong of flood free terrace originating 
from the old nucleus along Bouriganga River 
towards north as a part of Madhupur terrace (Dhaka 
Terrace). The Dhaka Terrace sloped towards 
eastern and western flood plains, marshes and 
Rivers. The Dhaka terrace was also crisscrossed by 
numerous water channels that drained the city as 
well as served as a main source of service and 
communication line.  
In this setting, after independence in 1971, 
tremendous population pressure has put Dhaka’s 
built-environment in a crisis situation. The 
objective of this paper is to understand the nature of 
the crisis and to explore for possible strategies to 
overcome the crisis.      
 
2. DHAKA’S URBAN GROWHT 
SCENARIO:  
 
Traditional settlement pattern in this region offered 
the best and integrated solutions towards human 
needs, in their relation with the nature, ecosystems 
and the community but contemporary development 
has ignored living with nature. The physiographic 
effect of water and land can be seen on the 
traditional settlement pattern, which sited on 
available ground or on artificial mounds created on 
the flood plains (Mowla,2008).  
 
Figure-1: Water bodies are illegally encroached 
upon creating drainage and water logging problems.  
In forties, about 50% of present Dhaka was low 
laying flood plain and wetlands. Many of the roads 
in Dhaka are developed by filling the water bodies 
or by making box-culverts, thus shrinking the water 
carrying capacity as well as reducing ground water 
replenishment. Destruction of these water channels 
and depressions has resulted in the disruption and 
alteration of the natural process of land accretion, 
land formation and ecosystems. Water logging 
(Fig-1) is an inherent problem associated with

uncontrolled urbanization and lack of holistic 
planning in Dhaka. 
 
3. POPULATION GROWTH,  
    MIGRATION AND HOUSING  
 
The population density in the slums is about 
531,000 persons per square mile which is still 
growing and occupy an area of only 4% of the total 
Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA), whereas the 
urban poor population is about one-third. It has 
been reported that only 30% people of this city 
shares 80% of the total residential area and the rest 
70% shares only 20% of residential area. Around 
3000 slums and squatters exist in the city in which 
almost 3 million people live with very little utility 
facilities (Fig-2). 
 
Figure-2: Uncontrolled Development at Koril 
The population growth in Dhaka is due to natural 
growth and huge in-migration. Currently, the 
population is estimated to be about 15 million 
people (about half of which live below the poverty 
line) live in about 340sq.km area of Dhaka. The 
existing overall, gross urban development density is 
89 persons per acre (ppa). In the inner zones, 
densities average 179 ppa, reaching a high density of 
323 ppa in the older quarters. Statistics show that the 
housing demand of the residents in Dhaka city 
increases by around 10 percent each year. It is 
estimated that about five lakh people migrate to 
Dhaka every year requiring about one lakh housing 
units and 95 percent of such people are poor. Public 
and private sectors combined together build around 
15,000-20,000 housing units a year to meet the 
staggering demand of about 100,000 units/year, of 
which real estate developers contribute only about 
5% of units in Dhaka each year that too for mostly 
higher income segment of the population. 
Approximately, 56 percent of the Dhaka city’s 
population lives in informal housing.  
Huge majority of migrants to Dhaka choose Dhaka 
because of centralized opportunities and central 
location. Migrants to the city of Dhaka are not all 
single minded individuals who possess transferable 
skills; many tend to be illiterate, unskilled, old, and 
ill equipped for the city. As such, migration to 
Dhaka places an additional burden to already 
fragile urban infrastructure and population. A study 
in 1987 revealed that 2.8 million of the poorest 
people lived on just 7 sq km of land and most of the 
residential development is unplanned. Motijheel is 
the Central Business District (CBD) of Dhaka city 
where 85% of housing is unplanned. The 
interesting case is Mirpur residential area where 
90% of housing is unplanned. According to same 
investigation about 75 % of the housing stock in 
Dhaka is unauthorized. The residential density in 
Old Dhaka is 313 persons to an acre. A 
conservative estimate of the person / room ratio in 
the residential quarters of old Dhaka is 7.5. Though 
this seems very dense, the average Floor Area Ratio 
(FAR) in Choukbazar was found to be only 0.85. 
There are only 17 acres of open space for over 
600,000 people.  
The gender composition of Dhaka’s population is 
balanced, but a significant portion of population is 
not stable. Most of the economically lower class 
people are single with their families in rural areas. 
UNCHS attributed this factor to the growing 
garment sector industries, which alone employ over 
700,000 women. Centralization of urban amenities 
and activities in Dhaka has resulted in population 
explosion. The rapid increase in urban population 
has made a tremendous claim on the already over-
utilized civic facilities and has created a state of 
disequilibria in the urban environment. 
 
 Figure-3: Concrete Jungle in Motijeel Area. 
Decentralization of facilities and amenities is 
therefore essential for Dhaka to survive (Fig-3&4).

Establishment of New Satellite towns around 
Dhaka to reduce pressure from it are however not 
suitable proposition in Bangladesh context where 
land is scarce and cultivatable land, wetland and 
open spaces are meagre. Existing urban centres 
around Dhaka (Savar, Narayanganj, Tongi, Gazipur 
etc. or across Bouriganga River) may be 
consolidated, controlled and planned to shift / 
neutralize some of Dhaka’s functions, particularly 
the activities that don’t need to be at the centre. 
However, these centres must have rapid, efficient 
and cheap communication connectivity with Dhaka.

MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS OF SOME MULTIPLE
ERGODIC AVERAGES
AI-HUA FAN, JO¨RG SCHMELING AND MENG WU
Abstract. In this paper we study the multiple ergodic averages
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq , · · · , xkql-1 ), (xn) ? Sm
on the symbolic space Sm = {0, 1, · · · ,m- 1}N* where m = 2, l =
2, q = 2 are integers. We give a complete solution to the problem of
multifractal analysis of the limit of the above multiple ergodic av-
erages. Actually we develop a non-invariant and non-linear version
of thermodynamic formalism that is of its own interest. We study
a large class of measures (called telescopic measures) and the spe-
cial case of telescopic measures defined by the fixed points of some
non-linear transfer operators plays a crucial role in studying our
multiplicatively invariant sets. These measures share many prop-
erties with Gibbs measures in the classical thermodynamic formal-
ism. Our work also concerns with variational principle, pressure
function and Legendre transform in this new setting.
1. Introduction
Let (X, T ) be a topological dynamical system where T is a continuous
map on a compact metric space X . Fu¨rstenberg had initiated the study
of the multiple ergodic average:
1
n
n?
k=1
f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx) · · ·fs(T skx) (1)
where f1, · · · , fs are s continuous functions on X with s = 2 when
he gave a proof of the existence of arithmetic sequences of arbitrary
length amongst sets of integers with positive density ([16]). Later on,
the research of such a kind of average has attributed a lot of attentions
(see e.g. [4, 6, 1, 17]).
The authors in [10] have recently proposed to analyze such multiple
ergodic averages from the point of view of multifractal analysis. They
have succeeded in a very special case where (X, T ) is the shift dynam-
ics on symbolic space and f1, · · · fs are Rademacher functions on the
symbolic space viewed as an additive group. It is a challenge to solve
the problem in its generality.
Key words and phrases. Multifractal, multiple ergodic average, Hausdorff
dimension.

2 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
In the present paper, we shall consider the problem for the shift
dynamics and for a class of functions f1, · · · , fs. The setting is as
follows. Let S = {0, · · · , m - 1} be a set of m symbols (m = 2).
Consider the shift map T on the symbolic space X = Sm = S
N. Fix
two integers q = 2 and l = 2. For any given l continuous functions
g1, g2, · · · , gl defined on X , we consider the multiple ergodic average
An(g1, g2 · · · , gl)(x) = 1
n
n?
k=1
g1(T
kx)g2(T
kqx) · · · gl(T kql-1x).
This is a special case of (1) with s = ql-1, fqj = gj-1 and fk = 1 for
other k 6= qj. Furthermore we assume that the functions f1, f2 · · · , fl
depend only on the first coordinate of x = (xk)k=0 ? Sm. So, under
this assumption of fj ’s we have
An(g1, g2 · · · , gl)(x) = 1
n
n?
k=1
g1(xk)g2(xkq) · · · gl(xkql-1). (2)
For the time being, there is no idea for the multifractal analysis of (1)
in its general form. So we are content with investigating the special
case (2). Actually we can do a little more. Given a function ? : Sl ? R
we shall study
An?(x) =
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xqk, · · · , xql-1). (3)
The average in (2) corresponds to the special case of (3) with ? =
g1 ? · · · ? gl. For a ? R, we define
E(a) =
{
x ? Sm : lim
n?8
An?(x) = a
}
.
Our problem is to determine the Hausdorff dimension of E(a). The
problem is classical when l = 1 and the answers are well known (see
e.g. [9, 11, 3, 2]). Let
amin = min
a1,··· ,al?S
?(a1, · · · , al), amax = max
a1,··· ,al?S
?(a1, · · · , al).
We assume that amin < amax (otherwise ? is constant and the problem
is trivial).
Let F(Sl-1,R+) be the cone of functions defined on Sl-1 taking non-
negative real values. For any s ? R, consider the transfer operator Ls
defined on F(Sl-1,R+) by
Ls?(a) =
?
j?S
es?(a,j)?(Ta, j) (4)
where T : Sl-1 ? Sl-2 is defined by T (a1, · · · , al-1) = (a2, · · · , al-1).
We also consider the non-linear operator Ns on F(Sl-1,R+) defined by
Ns?(a) = (Ls?(a))1/q.
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 3
We shall prove that the equation
Ns?s = ?s (5)
admits a unique strictly positive solution ?s = ?
(l-1)
s : Sl-1 ? R*+
(see Section 4, Theorem 4.1). The function ?s is defined on S
l-1. We
extend it on Sk for all 1 = k = l- 2 by induction:
?(k)s (a) =
(?
j?S
?(k+1)s (a, j)
) 1
q
, (a ? Sk). (6)
For simplicity, we will simply write ?s(a) = ?
(k)
s (a) for a ? Sk with
1 = k = l - 1. So, a 7? ?s(a) is not only defined on Sl-1 but on?
1=k=l-1 S
k.
Then we define the pressure function by
P?(s) = (q - 1)ql-2 log
?
j?S
?s(j). (7)
Throughout this paper, log means the natural logarithm.
We will prove that P?(s) is an analytic convex function of s ? R and
even strictly convex since amin < amax. The Legendre transform of P?
is defined as
P *?(a) = inf
s?R
(-sa + P?(s)).
We denote by L? the set of a ? R such that E(a) 6= Ø. One of the
main results of the paper is stated as follows.
Theorem 1.1. We have
L? = [P
'
?(-8), P '?(+8)].
If a = P '?(sa) for some sa ? R ? {-8,+8}, then E(a) 6= Ø and the
Hausdorff dimension of E(a) is equal to
dimH E(a) =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
This result was announced for l = 2 in [13]. It is obvious that
L? ? [amin, amax]. In general, this inclusion is strict. In fact, we have
the following criterion for L? = [amin, amax].
Theorem 1.2. We have the equality
P '?(-8) = amin
if and only if there exist an x = (xi)
8
i=1 ? Sm such that
?k = 1, ?(xk, xk+1, · · · , xk+l-1) = amin.
We have analogue criterion for P '?(+8) = amax.
4 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Let us look at the definition of
An?(x) =
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1).
One of the key points in our study of the problem is the observation
that the coordinates x1, · · · , xn, · · · of x appearing in the definition of
An?(x) share the following independence. This observation was first
exploited in [10] in order to compute the Box dimension of some subset
of E(amin). Consider the following partition of N*:
N* =
?
i=1,q?i
?i with ?i = {iqj}j=0.
Observe that if k = iqj with q ? i, then ?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) depends
only on x|?i , the restriction of x on ?i. So the summands in the defini-
tion of An?(x) can be put into different groups, each of which depends
on one restriction x|?i . For this reason, we decompose Sm as follows:
Sm =
?
i=1,q?i
S?i.
Let µ be a probability measure on Sm. Notice that S
?i is nothing
but a copy of Sm. We consider µ as a measure on S
?i for every i with
q ? i. Then we define the infinite product measure Pµ on
?
i=1,q?i S
?i of
the copies of µ. More precisely, for any word u of length n we define
Pµ([u]) =
?
i=n,q?i
µ([u|?i ]),
where [u] denotes the cylinder of all sequences starting with u. Then
Pµ is a probability measure on Sm and we call it a telescopic product
measure. Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak [18, 19] used this kind of mea-
sures to compute the Hausdorff dimension of sets like {x = (xn)n=1 ?
S2 : ?k = 1, xkx2k = 0} which was proposed in [10].
A class of measures Pµ will play the same role as Gibbs measures
played in the study of simple ergodic averages (l = 1). Concerning the
dimension of Pµ (see [8] for the dimension of a measure), we have the
following result which is one of the main ingredients of the proof of the
main result (Theorem 1.1) and which has its own interest. A measure
? on Sm is said to be exact if there exists an a ? R such that
lim
n?8
logm ?([x|n ])
n
= a, ?-a.e.
This value a is the dimension of ?.
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 5
Theorem 1.3. For any given measure µ, the telescopic product mea-
sure Pµ is exact and its dimension is equal to
dimH Pµ =
(q - 1)2
logm
8?
k=1
Hk(µ)
qk+1
where
Hk(µ) = -
?
a1,··· ,ak?S
µ([a1 · · · ak]) logµ([a1 · · · ak]).
A similar formula for some special Pµ has appeared in [19]. Another
ingredient of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is a law of large numbers relative
to the probability Pµ. We consider (
?
i=1,q?i S
?i,Pµ) as a probability
space (?,Pµ). Let (Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on Sm.
For each k, there exists a unique integer i(k) such that k = i(k)qj and
q ? i. Then
x 7? Fk(x|?i(k) )
defines a random variable on ?. Concerning the sequence of random
variables
{
Fk(x|?i(k) )
}
, we have the following law of large numbers.
Theorem 1.4. Let (Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on Sm.
Suppose that there exist C > 0 and 0 < ? < q3/2 such that for any
i = 1 with q ? i, any j1, j2 ? N, we have
covµ
(
Fiqj1 (x), Fiqj2 (x)
) = C? j1+j22 . (8)
Then for Pµ-a.e. x ? Sm
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
(
Fk(x|?i(k) )- EµFk(x)
)
= 0.
We observe that the set E(a) is not invariant. So it is not a standard
set studied from the classical dynamical system point of view. Actually,
as we shall see, in general the dimension of the set E(a) can not be
described by invariant measures supported on it. This is confirmed by
the following result.
Given two real valued functions f1 and f2 defined on Sm. For a ? R,
let E(a) be the set of all points x such that
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx) = a.
We describe the size of the invariant part of E(a) by
Finv(a) = sup {dimµ : µ ergodic, µ(E(a)) = 1 } .
6 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Theorem 1.5. Let f1 and f2 be two Ho¨lder continuous functions on
Sm. If E(a) supports an ergodic measure, then
Finv(a) = sup
{
dimµ : µ ergodic,
?
f1dµ
?
f2dµ = a
}
.
It is interesting to compare this result with the level sets of V -
statistics studied in [14]. We return to the above theorem. A re-
markable corollary is that when f1 = f2, we must have a = 0 if E(a)
supports an ergodic measure, or even an invariant measure (using Ja-
cobs’ entropy decomposition). Therefore, it is possible that for some
a < 0, E(a) has strictly positive Hausdorff dimension but it doesn’t
carry any invariant measure.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first construct
a class of measures, called telescopic product measures, part of which
will play the same role as Gibbs measures played in the classical the-
ory. This construction is inspired by Kenyon-Peres-Solomyak [18] (also
see [19]). Then we establish a law of large numbers relative to such a
telescopic product measure. Telescopic product measures constitute a
new object of study. In Section 3, we prove that any telescopic product
measure is exact and we obtain a formula for its dimension. In Section
4, we study a non–linear transfer operator and we prove the existence
and the uniqueness of its positive solution. We also prove the analyt-
icity and the convexity of the solution as a function of its parameter
s. Each solution defines a Markov measure associated to which is a
telescopic product measure. The last measure plays the role of a Gibbs
measure in our study of E(a). Section 5 is devoted to the properties
of the pressure function: a Ruelle type formula says that the limit in
the law of large numbers is the derivative of the pressure; the pressure
function is an analytic and strictly convex function (except the trivial
case); the extreme values of the derivative of the pressure are studied.
In Section 6, we establish the Gibbs property of the telescopic product
measures defined by the solution of the non–linear transfer operator.
After all these preparations, many of which have their own interests,
we prove the main theorem (Theorem 1.1) in Section 7. In Section
8, we discuss the invariant part of E(a). Some concrete examples are
presented in Section 9. In the final section, we make some remarks and
present some unsolved problems.
Acknowledgement: The authors would like to thank B. Host for his
interests in the work and especially for his remarks, some of which are
contained in Section 8.
2. Telescopic product measures and LLN
In this section, we will study telescopic product measures and estab-
lish a law of large numbers (LLN). These measures, which take into
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 7
account the multiplicative structure of the multiple ergodic averages
An?(x), will play the same role as Gibbs measures played in the study
of simple ergodic averages. In the next section, we will prove that Pµ
is exact and its dimension is equal to
dimH Pµ =
(q - 1)2
logm
8?
k=1
Hk(µ)
qk+1
where
Hk(µ) = -
?
a1,··· ,ak?S
µ([a1 · · · ak]) logµ([a1 · · · ak]).
We could call Hk the k-th entropy of µ. But we should point out that
µ is not assumed to be invariant and that Pµ is not invariant either.
2.1. Telescopic product measures. Let us recall the definition of
the telescopic product measure Pµ. Consider the following partition of
N*:
N* =
?
i=1,q?i
?i with ?i = {iqj}j=0.
Then we decompose Sm as follows:
Sm =
?
i=1,q?i
S?i.
Let µ be a probability measure on Sm. We consider µ as a measure
on S?i , which is identified with Sm, for every i with q ? i. Then we
define the infinite product measure Pµ on
?
i=1,q?i S
?i of the copies of
µ. More precisely, for any word u of length n we define
Pµ([u]) =
?
i=n,q?i
µ([u|?i ]),
where [u] denotes the cylinder of all sequences starting with u.
We consider (Sm,Pµ) as a probability space. Let Xk(x) = xk be the
k-th coordinate projection. For each i with q ? i, consider the process
Y (i) = (Xk)k??i. Then, by the definition of Pµ, the following fact is
obvious.
Lemma 2.1. The processes Y (i) = (Xk)k??i for different i = 1 with q ?
i are Pµ-independent and identically distributed with µ as the common
probability law.
As we shall see, the behaviour of An?(x) as n? 8 will be described
by measures Pµ with particular choices of µ. It is natural that Pµ
strongly depends on the above partition of N*. The following is a
detail of the partition which will be useful. Fix n ? N*. Let
?i(n) = ?i n {1, · · · , n}.
We are going to examine the cardinality ??i(n), called the length of
?i(n) and the number N(n, q, k) of ?i(n)’s of a given length k.
8 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Lemma 2.2. Let k, n ? N*.
(1) ??i(n) = k if and only if
n
qk
< i = n
qk-1
. Consequently we have
??i(n) =
?
logq
n
i
?
.
(2) We have the partition
{1, · · · , n} =
?logq n??
k=1
?
n
qk
<i= n
qk-1
,q?i
?i(n).
(3) N(n, q, k) is the number of i’s such that q ? i and n
qk
< i = n
qk-1
.
We have ||||N(n, q, k)n - (q - 1)2qk+1
|||| = 4n.
Proof. (1) It is simply because ??i(n) = k means that
?i(n) = {i, iq, · · · , iqk-1} with iqk-1 = n < iqk.
(2) We have the obvious partition

Now we consider (
?
i=1,q?i S
?i,Pµ) as a probability space (?,Pµ). Let
(Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on Sm. For each k, there
exists a unique integer i(k) such that k = i(k)qj and q ? i. Then x 7?
Fk(x|?i(k) ) defines a random variable on ?. Later, we will study the law
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 9
of large numbers for the sequence of variables {Fk(x|?i(k) )}k=1. Notice
that if i(k) 6= i(k'), then the two variables Fk(x|?i(k) ) and Fk'(x|?i(k') )
are independent. But if i(k) = i(k'), they are not independent in
general. In order to prove the law of large numbers, we will need the
following technical lemma which allows us to compute the expectation
of the product of Fk(x|?i(k) )’s. The proof of the lemma is based on the
independence of x|?i ’s.
Lemma 2.3. Let (Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on Sm.
Then for any integer N = 1, we have
EPµ

.
In particular, for any function G defined on Sm, for any n = 1,
EPµG(x|?i(n) ) = EµG(·).
Proof. Let
QN (x) =
N?
k=1
Fk(x|?i(k) ), QN,i(x) =
?
k??i(N)
Fk(x|?i ).
Since the variables x|?i for different i = 1 with q ? i are independent
under Pµ (by Lemma 2.1), we have
EPµQN =
?
i=N,q?i
EPµQN,i. (9)
Then, by (2) of Lemma 2.2, we can rewrite the right hand side in (9)
to get
EPµQN =
?logq N??
k=1
?
N
qk
<i= N

However, the marginal measures on S?i of Pµ is equal to µ and ?i(N) =
{i, iq, · · · , iqk-1} if N
qk
< i = N
qk-1
. So
EPµQN,i = Eµ

.
Now, for any function G defined on Sm and any n ? N*, if we set
Fn = G and Fk = 1 for k 6= n we have
EPµG(x|?i(n) ) = EµG(x).

2.2. Law of large numbers. In order to prove the law of large num-
bers (LLN), we need the following result.
Recall that the covariance of two bounded functions f, g with respect
to µ is defined by
covµ(f, g) = Eµ [(f - Eµf)(g - Eµg)]
Proposition 2.4. Let (Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on
Sm satisfying
covµ
(
Fiqj1 (x)Fiqj2 (x)
) = C? j1+j22 (10)
for some constants C > 0 and 0 < ? < q3/2 and for all i = 1 with q ? i
and all j1, j2 ? N. Let p0, p1 and p2 be three maps from N* into N* such
that

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that EPµFk(x|?i(k) ) =
0 for all k ? N*. Otherwise, we replace Fk(x|?i(k) ) by Fk(x|?i(k) ) -
EPµFk(x|?i(k) ). We denote

However by the hypothesis (10) on the sequence (Fk)k=1, for any u, v ?
?i n [p1(n), p2(n)] we have||EPµYuYv|| = |EµFu(x)Fv(x)| = C?logq p2(n)i .

The cardinality ? (?i n [p1(n), p2(n)]) is estimated as follows:
? (?i n [p1(n), p2(n)]) = 1 + logq a. (14)
In fact, assume that
?i n [p1(n), p2(n)] = {a1, · · · , ak}
with a1 < · · · < ak. Then by the definition of ?i, we must have aj+1aj = q
for 1 = j = k - 1 so that
ak
a1
= qk-1.
On the other hand,
ak
a1

So qk-1 = a, i.e. k = 1 + logq a. Substituting (14) into (13), we get

We conclude by the hypothesis which says that the right hand side of
the above estimate is the general term of a convergent series. 
The following is the LLN which will be useful for our computation
of the dimension of the telescopic product measure Pµ.
Theorem 2.5. Let (Fk)k=1 be a sequence of functions defined on Sm.
Suppose that there exist C > 0 and 0 < ? < q3/2 such that for any
i = 1 with q ? i, any j1, j2 ? N,
covµ

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that EPµFk(x|?i(k) ) =

Xk with Xk = Fk(x|?i(k)).
First we claim that it suffices to show
lim
n?8
Yn2 = 0, Pµ - a.e. (17)
In fact, for every n ? N there exists a unique k ? N such that k2 =
n < (k + 1)2. Then we have
|Yn| = |Yk2|+
(|Xk2+1|+ · · ·+ |Xn|+ · · ·+ |X(k+1)2 |)
k2
.
So, since Yk2 ? 0 Pµ-a.e., we have only to show
lim
k?8
(|Xk2+1|+ · · ·+ |Xn|+ · · ·+ |X(k+1)2 |)
k2
= 0, Pµ - a.e. (18)
Let p0, p1 and p2 be the three maps from N* to N* defined as follows:
p0(k) = p1(k) = k
2, p2(k) = (k + 1)
2 for k ? N*.
Then observe that
1 = p2(k)

j1 and v = iqj2 with 0 = j1, j2 = ??i(n). By the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the hypothesis (16), we obtain||EPµXuXv|| =vEµF 2uvEµF 2v = C???i(n).
This estimate holds for all u, v ? ?i(n). So?
u,v??i(n)
|EPµXuXv| = C (??i(n))2 ???i(n).
Substituting this estimate into (20) and using (1) of Lemma 2.2, we
get

Therefore we can re-write
F (xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) = Fk(x|?i(k) ).

3. Dimensions of telescopic product measures
Let ? be a measure on Sm. The lower local dimension of ? at a point
x ? Sm is defined as
D(?, x) := lim inf
n?8
- logm ?([xn1 ])
n
.
Similarly, we can define the upper local dimension D(?, x). IfD(?, x) =
D(?, x), we write D(?, x) for the common value and we say that ?
admits D(?, x) as the exact local dimension at x. See [8] for the di-
mensions of measures. Recall that the Hausdorff dimension of a Borel
measure ?, denoted by dimH ?, is the minimal dimension of Borel sets
of full measure and is equal to ess sup?D(?, x) ([8]).
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 15
In this section, as a consequence of the LLN, we will prove that
every telescopic product measure Pµ admits its exact local dimension
for Pµ-a.e. point in Sm, which is a constant.
3.1. Local dimension of telescopic product measures. For a mea-
sure µ on Sm and for k = 1, we define
Hk(µ) = -
?
a1,··· ,ak
µ([a1 · · · ak]) logµ([a1 · · · ak]).
We note that for a probability measure µ we have 0 = Hk(µ) = k logm.
Theorem 3.1. For Pµ-a.e. x ? Sm, we have
D(Pµ, x) =
(q - 1)2
logm
8?
k=1
Hk(µ)
qk+1
.
Proof. By the definition of Pµ, we have
log Pµ([x
n
1 ]) =
?
i=n,q?i
logµ([xn1 |?i(n)]) =
?logq n??
k=1
?
n
qk
<i= n
qk-1
q?i
log µ([xn1 |?i(n)]).
(21)
Recall that xn1 |?i(n) = xixiqxiq2 · · ·xiq??i-1 . So
µ([xn1 |?i(n)]) = µ([xixiqxiq2 · · ·xiq??i-1 ]).
Let us write µ([xn1 |?i(n)]) in the following way
µ([xn1 |?i(n)]) = µ([xi])
??i-1?
j=1
µ([xixiqxiq2 · · ·xiqj ])
µ([xixiqxiq2 · · ·xiqj-1 ]) .
Now we define a suitable sequence of functions (Fk)k=1 on Sm in order
to express µ([xn1 |?i(n)]). If k = i such that q ? i, we define
Fk(x) = Fi(x) = - logµ([x0]).
If k = iqj with q ? i and j = 1, we define
Fk(x) = Fiqj (x) = - log µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj ])
µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj-1]) .
Then, we have the following relationship between Fk and µ.
- logµ([xn1 |?i]) =
?
k??i(n)
Fk(x|?i ).
Substituting this expression into (21) we obtain
- log Pµ([xn1 ]) =
n?
k=1
Fk(x|?i(k) ). (22)
16 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Now we check that the sequence (Fk)k=1 verifies the hypothesis (16) of
the law of large numbers (Theorem 2.5). Notice that for any x ? Sm
and any j = 1, we have
|Fiqj(x)| =
||||log µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj ])µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj-1])
|||| = |log µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj ])| .
This is because log x
y
= log 1
x
when 0 = x = y = 1. So, for any i ? N*
with q ? i and j = 0, we have
Eµ
(
Fiqj (x)
)2 = ?
x0,··· ,xj?S
µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj ]) (log µ([x0, x1, · · · , xj ]))2 .
Then by Lemma 3.3 stated below, we obtain
Eµ
(
Fiqj (x)
)2
= O(j2)
which implies through Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
Eµ
||Fiqj1 (x)Fiqj2 (x)|| = O((j1 + j2)2).
This quadratic estimate is more than the exponential estimate required
by the hypothesis (16). By the law of large numbers, we have

k-1?

Remark 3.2. Even if the measure µ itself is not exact dimensional the
telescopic measure Pµ is. This is because the Pµ-measure of a cylinder
of length N is governed by the measure µ on short pieces ?i(N) while
the non-exactness of µ can be seen only on long cylinders. These short
pieces are independent.
3.2. An elementary inequality. In the last proof we have used the
following elementary estimation. For n = 1, let
Pn :=
{
p = (p1, · · · , pn) ? Rn+,
n?
i=1
pi = 1
}
be the set of probability vectors. We define Ln : Pn -? R+ by
Ln(p) =
n?
i=1
pi(log pi)
2.
Lemma 3.3. There exists a constant D > 0 such that
max
p?Pn
Ln(p) = (logn)2 +D log n.
Proof. The function x 7? x(log x)2 is bounded on [0, 1] and attains
its maximal values 4e-2 at x = e-2. Hence the inequality holds for
n = 2 with D = 8e-2. Now we prove the inequality by induction on
n. Suppose that the inequality holds for n = N . Let p ? PN+1 be a
maximal point of LN+1. If p is on the boundary of PN+1, then there
exists at least one component pi0 of p such that pi0 = 0. So
LN+1(p) =
?
1=i=N+1,i 6=i0
pi(log pi)
2 = LN (p
')
where p' = (p1, · · · , pi0-1, pi0+1, · · · , pN+1) is in PN . In this case, we
can conclude by the hypothesis of induction. Now we suppose that
p is not on the boundary of PN+1. We use the method of Lagrange
multiplier. Differentiating LN+1(p) yields
?LN+1
?pi
(p) = (log pi)
2 + 2 log pi, (1 = i = N + 1).
So we have
(log pi)
2 + 2 log pi = ?, (1 = i = N + 1) (25)

The components of the maximal point p = (p1, · · · , pN+1) have two
choices: a or b. So
LN+1(p) = ka(log a)
2 + (N + 1- k)b(log b)2, (26)
where k (0 = k = N +1) is the number of a’s taken by the components
of p. Recall that ka+ (N + 1- k)b = 1. Notice that
ka(log a)2 = ka(log ka-log k)2 = ka(log ka)2+ka(log k)2-2ka(log ka) log k.
(27)
Since maxx?[0,1]-x log x = 1e and maxx?[0,1] x(log x)2 = 4e2 , we get
ka(log a)2 = 4
e2
+ka(log k)2+
2
e
log k = 4
e2
+ka(log(N+1))2+
2
e
log(N+1).
A similar estimate holds for (N+1-k)b(log b)2. Put these two estimates
into (26), we get
PN+1(p) = 8
e2
+ (log(N + 1))2 +
4
e
log(N + 1).
We conclude that the inequality holds with D = 8
e2
+ 4

4. Non-linear transfer equation
Our study of An?(x) will depend upon a class of special telescopic
product measures Pµ where µ is a (l-1)-Markov measure. Our (l-1)-
Markov measures are nothing but Markov measures with Sl as state
space. The transition probability of such a (l - 1)-Markov measure
will be determined by the solution of a non-linear transfer equation.
In this section, we will study this non-linear transfer equation, find its
positive solution and construct the (l - 1)-Markov measure and the
corresponding telescopic product measure.
4.1. Non-linear transfer equation. Let F(Sl-1,R+) denote the cone
of functions defined on Sl-1 taking non-negative real values. It is iden-
tified with a subset in the Euclidean space Rm
l-1
. Let A : Sl ? R+ be
a given function. We define a non-linear operator N : F(Sl-1,R+) ?
F(Sl-1,R+) by
N y(a1, a2, · · · , al-1) =
(?
j?S
A(a1, a2, · · · , al-1, j)y(a2, · · · , al-1, j)
) 1
q
.
(28)
We are interested in positive fixed points of the operator N . That
means we are interested in y ? F(Sl-1,R+) such that N y = y and
y(a) > 0 for all a ? Sl-1. In general, such fixed points of N may not
exist. If N admits a positive fixed point, then for each (a1, · · · , al-1) ?
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 19
Sl-1, there exists at least one j ? S such that A(a1, · · · , al-1, j) is
strictly positive. In fact, this is also a sufficient condition.
Theorem 4.1. Suppose that A is non-negative and that for every
(a1, · · · , al-1) ? Sl-1 there exists at least one j ? S such that A(a1, · · · ,
al-1, j) > 0. Then N has a unique positive fixed point.
Proof. We define a partial order on F(Sl-1,R+), denoted by =, as
follows:
y1 = y2 ? y1(a) = y2(a), ?a ? Sl-1.
It is obvious that N is increasing with respect to this partial order, i.e.,
y1 = y2 ? N (y1) = N (y2).
Uniqueness. We first prove the uniqueness of the positive fixed point
by contradiction. Suppose that there are two distinct positive fixed
points y1 and y2 for N . Without loss of generality we can suppose that
y1  y2. Let
? = inf{? > 1, y1 = ?y2}.
It is clear that ? is a well defined real number and y1 = ?y2. Since
y1  y2, we must have ? > 1. On the other hand, by the definition of
N , the operator N is homogeneous in the sense that
N (cy) = c 1qN (y), ?y ? F(Sl-1,R+), ?c ? R+.
It follows that
y1 = N (y1) = N (?y2) = ?
1
qN (y2) = ?
1
q y2.
This is a contradiction to the minimality of ? for ?
1
q < ?.
Existence. Now we prove the existence. Let
?1 =
(
min
a?Sl
A(a)
) 1
q-1
, ?2 =
(
mmax
a?Sl
A(a)
) 1
q-1
.
Consider the restriction of N on the compact set F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]) con-
sisting of functions on Sl-1 taking values in [?1, ?2]. By the definitions
of ?1 and ?2, the compact set F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]) is N -invariant, i.e.,
N (F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2])) ? F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]).
In fact, let y ? F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]) and let yj0 = minj yj. Then yj0 = ?1
and A(a, j0) = ?q-11 for all a ? Sl-1, so that
N y(a) = (A(a, j0)yj0)1/q = ?1.
The verification of N y(a) = ?2 is even easier.
Now take any function y0 from the compact set F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]). By
the monotonicity of N , we get an increasing sequence
y0 = N (y0) = N 2(y0) = · · · .
20 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Since F(Sl-1, [?1, ?2]) is compact, the limit g = limn?8N n(y0) exists.
It is a fixed point of N . 
From now on, we concentrate on the following special case:
A(a) = es?(a), (a ? Sl)
where s ? R is a parameter. The corresponding operator will be de-
noted by Ns. By Theorem 4.1, there exists a unique positive fixed
point for Ns. We denote this fixed point by ?s. In the following, we
are going to study the analyticity and the convexity of the functions
s 7? ?s(a).
4.2. Analyticity of s 7? ?s(a).
Proposition 4.2. For every a ? Sl-1, the function s ? ?s(a) is
analytic on R.
Proof. We consider the map G : R× R*ml-1+ ? Rml-1 defined by
G(s, (za)a?Sl-1) = (Gb(s, (za)a?Sl-1))b?Sl-1 ,
where
G(b1,··· ,bl-1)(s, (za)a?Sl-1) = z
q
(b1,··· ,bl-1)
-
?
j?S
es?(b1,··· ,bl-1,j)z(b2,··· ,bl-1,j).
It is clear that G is analytic. By Theorem 4.1, we have
G(s, (?s(a))a?Sl-1) = 0.
Moreover the uniqueness in Theorem 4.1 implies that for any fixed
s ? R, (?s(a))a?Sl-1 is the unique positive vector satisfying the above
equation. For practice, in the following we will write ?s = (?s(a))a?Sl-1
and z = (za)a?Sl-1 .
By the implicit function theorem, if the Jacobian matrix
D(s) =
(
?Ga
?zb
(s, ?s)
)
(a,b)?Sl-1×Sl-1
is invertible on a point s0 ? R, then there exist a neighbourhood (s0 -
r0, s0 + r0) of s0, a neighbourhood V of ?s in Rm
l-1
and a analytic
function f on (s0 - r0, s0 + r0) taking values in V such that for any
(t, z) ? (s0 - r0, s0 + r0)× V , we have
G(t, z) = 0 ? f(t) = z.
Then by the uniqueness of ?s for fixed s, we have ?t = f(t). So the
functions s ? ?s(a) (a ? Sl-1), which are coordinate functions of f ,
are analytic in (s0 - r0, s0 + r0).
We now prove that the matrix D(s) is invertible for any s ? R. To
this end, we consider the following matrix
D˜(s) =
(
?s(b)
?Ga
?zb
(s, ?s)
)
(a,b)?Sl-1×Sl-1
,
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 21
which is the one obtained by multiplying the b-th column of D(s) by
?s(b) for each b ? Sl-1. Then we have the following relation between
the determinants of D(s) and D˜(s):
det(D˜(s)) =
( ?
a?Sl-1
?s(a)
)
det(D(s)).
So we only need to prove that D˜(s) is invertible. We will prove this
by showing that D˜(s) is strictly diagonal dominating and by applying
the Gershgorin circle theorem (also called Levy-Desplanques Theorem)
(see e.g. [24]). Recall that a matrix is said to be strictly diagonal
dominating if for every row of the matrix, the modulus of the diagonal
entry in the row is strictly larger than the sum of the modulus of all
the other (non-diagonal) entries in that row.
Let a = (a1, · · · , al-1) be fixed. The function Ga(s, ·) depends only
on za and zb’s with b = (a2, · · · , al-1, j). So
?Ga
?zb
(s, ?s) 6= 0
only if b = a or b = (a2, · · · , al-1, j) for some j ? S. It is possible
that a = (a2, · · · , al-1, j) for some j ? S and it is actually the case if
and only if a = (j, j, · · · , j). To effectively apply the implicit function
theorem, we only need to show that for any a = (a1, · · · , al-1), we have||||?s(a)?Ga?za (s, ?s)
||||- ?
j?S,
b=(a2,··· ,al-1,j)6=a
||||?s(b)?Ga?zb (s, ?s)
|||| > 0. (29)
In fact, we have
?Ga
?za
(s, ?s) =
{
q?q-1s (a)- es?(a,j) if a = (j, · · · , j) for some j ? S,
q?q-1s (a) otherwise.
and for b = (a2, · · · , al-1, j) 6= a, we have
?Ga
?zb
(s, ?s) = e
s?(a,j).
Then, substituting the last two expressions into (29), we obtain that
the member at the left hand side of (29) is equal to
q?qs(a)-
?
j?S
es?(a,j)?s(a2, · · · , al-1, j) = (q - 1)?qs(a) > 0.
For the last equality we have used the fact that ?s is the solution of
Ns?s = fs. 
22 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Our function ?s is defined on S
l-1. We extend it on Sk for all
1 = k = l- 2 by induction on k as follows
?s(a) =
(?
j?S
?s(a, j)
) 1
q
, (?a ? Sk).
It is clear that all these functions ?s are strictly positive for all s ? R.
Corollary 4.3. For any a ? ?1=k=l-1 Sk, the function s ? ?s(a) is
analytic on R.
4.3. Convexity of s 7? ?s(a). In this subsection, we prove that the
functions s ? ?s(a) for a ?
?
1=k=l-1 S
k and the pressure function
P?(s) are convex functions on R.
The following lemma is nothing but the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
We will use it in this form several times in the proof of the convexity.
Lemma 4.4. Let (aj)
m-1
j=0 and (bj)
m-1
j=0 be two sequences of non-negative
real numbers. Then(
m-1?
j=0
ajbj
)2
=
(
m-1?
j=0
ajb
2
j
)(
m-1?
j=0
aj
)
.
Proof. We write ajbj =
v
ajbj · vaj and then use the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality. 
Let ?s1 =
(
mina?Sl e
s?(a)
) 1
q-1 . In the proof of Theorem 4.1, we have
shown that
?s = lim
n?8
N ns (?s1),
where ?s1 the function on S
l-1 which is constantly equal to ?s1. By the
definition of Ns, it is obvious that
N ns (?s1) = (?s1)
1
qnN n(1),
where 1 is the function constantly equal to 1. However, for any s ? R,
we have limn?8(?
s
1)
1
qn = 1, so that
?s = lim
n?8
N ns (1).
The above convergence is actually uniform for s in any compact set of
R. Let
?s,n = N ns (1).
In order to prove convexity of the functions
s 7? ?s(a), log
?
j?S
?s(b, j), (a ? Sl-1, b ? Sl-2)
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 23
we have only to show those of
s 7? ?s,n(a), log
?
j?S
?s,n(b, j).
Actually we will make a proof by induction on n.
Recall that a function H of class C2 is convex if H '' = 0. A function
H of class C2 is log-convex if logH is convex or equivalently H ''H =
(H ')2.
First we have the following initiation of the induction.
Lemma 4.5. For any a ? Sl-1, the function s 7? Ls1(a) is log-convex.
Proof. The log-convexity of s 7? Ls1(a) is equivalent to
(Ls1(a))2 = (Ls1(a))''(Ls1(a)).
Recall the definition of Ls1(a):
Ls1(a) =
?
j?S
es?(Ta,j).
Notice that(
es?(a,b)
)'
= es?(a,b)?(a, b),
(
es?(a,b)
)''
= es?(a,b)?2(a, b).
Then log-convexity of s 7? Ls1(a) is equivalent to(?
j?S
es?(Ta,j)?(Ta, j)
)2
=
(?
j?S
es?(Ta,j)?(Ta, j)2
)(?
j?S
es?(Ta,j)
)
.
This is nothing but the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (see Lemma 4.4).

The induction will be based on the following recursive relation
?s,n+1(a) = Ns?s,n(a), equivalently (?s,n+1(a))q = Ls?s,n(a).
We are going to show that if s 7? Ls?s,n(a) is log-convex, then so is
s 7? Ls?s,n+1(a) and even s 7? Ns?s,n(a) = ?s,n+1(a) is convex and?
j?S
?s,n+1(b, j)
is log-convex.
Lemma 4.6. Let (us)s?R be a family of functions in F(Sl-1). We
suppose that for a ? Sl-1, s 7? us(a) is twice differentiable with respect
to s ? R. Let
vs(a) = Nsus(a).
Suppose that for any a ? Sl-1, s 7? Lsus(a) is log-convex. Then
(1) For all a ? Sl-1, s 7? vs(a) is convex.
(2) For all b ? Sl-2, s 7??j?S vs(b, j) is log-convex.
(3) For all a ? Sl-1, s 7? Lsvs(a) is log-convex.
24 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Proof. By the hypothesis, for each a ? Sl-1, the function s 7? Lsus(a)
is log-convex. That is to say, if we let Hs(a) = Lsus(a), we have
H ''s (a)Hs(a) = (H 's(a))2 , (30)
where, as well as in the following, ' and '' will refer to the derivatives
with respect to s.
(1) Since vs(a) = (Hs(a))
1/q, we have
(vs(a))
' =
1
q
(Hs(a))
1
q
-1H 's(a).
In other words,
(vs(a))
' = vs(a)Rs(a) (31)
with
Rs(a) =
1
q
H 's(a)
Hs(a)
.
Furthermore we have
(vs(a))
'' =
1
q
(
1
q
- 1
)
(Hs(a))
1
q
-2[H 's(a)]
2 +
1
q
(Hs(a))
1
q
-1H ''s (a)
=
1
q2
(Hs(a))
1
q
-2[H 's(a)]
2 +
1
q
(Hs(a))
1
q
-2[Hs(a)H
''
s (a)- (H 's(a))2].
By the hypothesis (30), (vs(a))
'' = 0. Thus we have proved (1). The
last equality implies
(vs(a))
'' = 1
q2
(Hs(a))
1
q
-2[H 's(a)]
2.
In other words,
(vs(a))
'' = vs(a)[Rs(a)]2. (32)
The relations (31) and (32) will be useful later.
(2) By (32), we have(?
j?S
(vs(b, j))
''
)(?
j?S
vs(b, j)
)
=
(?
j?S
vs(b, j)Rs(b, j)
2
)(?
j?S
vs(b, j)
)
.
Then, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form of Lemma 4.4, we
have(?
j?S
(vs(b, j))
''
)(?
j?S
vs(b, j)
)
=
(?
j?S
vs(b, j)Rs(b, j)
)2
=
(?
j?S
(vs(b, j))
'
)2
where the last equality is due to (31). Thus we have proved (2).
(3) Recall that
Lvs(a) =
?
j?S
es?(Ta,j)vs(Ta, j).
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 25
Notice that
d
ds
es?(a,b)vs(Ta, j)
= es?(a,j)
[
?(a, j)vs(Ta, b) + (vs(Ta, j))
'
]
,
d2
ds2
es?(a,b)vs(Ta, j)
= es?(a,j)
[
?2(a, j)vs(Ta, j) + 2?(a, j)(vs(Ta, j))
' + (vs(Ta, j))
''
]
.
By using (31), we can write
d
ds
es?(a,b)vs(Ta, j) = e
s?(a,j)vs(Ta, j) [?(a, j) +Rs(Ta, j)] .
By using (31) and (32), we get
?2(a, j)vs(Ta, j)+2?(a, j)(vs(Ta, j))
'+(vs(Ta, j))
'' = [?(a, j) +Rs(Ta, j)]2 ,
so that
d2
ds2
es?(a,b)vs(Ta, j) = es?(a,j)vs(Ta, j) [?(a, j) +Rs(Ta, j)]2 .
There
(Lsvs(a))''Lsvs(a) =
(?
j?S
Cs(Ta, j)Ds(a, j)
2
)(?
j?S
Cs(a, j)
)
.
where
Cs(a, j) = e
s?(a,j)vs(Ta, j), Ds(a, j) = ?(a, j) +Rs(Ta, j).
Then, by the Cauchy inequality (see Lemma 4.4), we finally get
(Lsvs(a))''Lsvs(a) =
(?
j?S
Cs(a, j)Ds(a, j)
)2
= [(Lsvs(a))']2.
That is the log-convexity of s 7? Lsvs(a). 
Theorem 4.7. For any a ? ?1=j=l Sl-j, the function s 7? ?s(a) is
convex. The pressure function P?(s) is also convex.
Proof. We prove convexity of s 7? ?s(a) for a ? Sl-1 by showing those
of s 7? ?s,n(a) by induction on n. The induction is based on Lemma 4.5
and Lemma 4.6 (only the points (1) and (3) are used).
Now we prove convexity of s 7? ?s(a) for a ? Sl-k (2 = k = l)
by induction on k and by using what we have just proved above (as
the initiation of induction). We can do that because of the following
recursive relation: for a ? Sl-k (2 = k = l), we have
?s(a)
q =
?
j?S
?s(a, j).
The right hand side is the operator Ls defined by the ? which is
identically zero. So the log-convexity of ?s(a, j) implies that of ?s(a)
just as the log-convexity of ?s,n implies that of ?s,n+1(a).
26 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Recall that the pressure function is proportional to
s 7? log?s(Ø) = log
?
j?S
?s(j).
The convexity of the pressure is just the log-convexity of
?
j?S ?s(j),
which is implied by Lemma 4.6 (3) and the log-convexity of ?s(j). 
4.4. Construction of the measures µs and Pµs. Below we construct
a class of (l- 1)-Markov measure µs whose transition probability and
initial law are determined by the fixed point ?s of the operator Ns.
The corresponding telescopic product measure Pµs will play the same
role as Gibbs measure played in the study of simple ergodic averages.
Fix s ? R. Let ?s be the function mentioned above. Recall that ?s
was first defined on Sl-1 as follows
(?s(a))
q =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?s(Ta, b), (a ? Sl-1).
Then it was extended on Sk by induction on 1 = k = l- 2 as follows
?s(a) =
(?
b?S
?s(a, b)
) 1
q
, (a ? Sk).
These functions defined on words of length varying from 1 to l - 1
allow us to define a (l- 1)-step Markov measure on Sm, which will be
denoted by µs, with the initial law
ps([a1, · · · , al-1]) =
l-1?
j=1
?s(a1, · · · , aj)
?qs(a1, · · · , aj-1) (33)
and the transition probability
Qs ([a1, · · · , al-1], [a2, · · · , al]) = es?(a1,··· ,al) ?s(a2, · · · , al)
?qs(a1, · · · , al-1) . (34)
Here we have identified Sm with (S
l-1)N. Actually, ps is a probability
vector because ?
aj?S
?s(a1, · · · , aj)
?qs(a1, · · · , aj-1) = 1
and Q is a transition probability because Ns?s = ?s.
As usual, Pµs will denote the telescopic product measure associated
to µs. See §2.1 for its definition and its general properties.
5. Properties of the pressure function
We have seen in the previous section that the pressure function is
real analytic and convex on R. In this section we continue to discuss
some of its further properties. These properties mainly concern its
strict convexity when amin < amax and a Ruelle type formula relating
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 27
the expected limit of the multiple ergodic average with respect to the
measure Pµs and the derivative of P?.
5.1. Ruelle type formula. We state here the following identity which
can be regarded as an analogue of Ruelle’s derivative formula concern-
ing the classical Gibbs measure and pressure function, its proof will be
given in Section 7.4 (Proposition 7.8).
Theorem 5.1. We have
(q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = P '?(s).
As an applications of Theorem 5.1, we give the following formula
concerning the value P '?(0).
Proposition 5.2.
P '?(0) =
?
a?Sl ?(a)
ml
.
Proof. By Theorem 5.1, we have
P '?(0) = (q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµ0?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1). (35)
First of all, we need to determine µ0. It is straightforward to verify
that the constant function ?0 = m
1
q-1 is a solution of the following
equations when s = 0.
(?s(a))
q =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?s(Ta, b), (a ? Sl-1).
Actually, the function ?0 is the only positive solution by uniqueness of
the positive solution (Theorem 4.1). The measure µ0 defined by this
solution as in (33) and (34) is the Lebesgue measure. So, for any j = 0
we have
Eµ0?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) =
?
x0,··· ,xj+l-1
µ0([x
j+l-1
0 ])?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1)
=
?
x0,··· ,xj+l-1
m-(j+l)?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1)
=
?
x0,··· ,xl-1
m-l?(x0, · · · , xl-1)
=
?
a?Sl ?(a)
ml
.
Now we get the desired result by substituting the above expression
in (35) and by an elementary calculation. 
28 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
5.2. Translation via linearity.
Theorem 5.3. For any ß ? R, we have
P?(s)- ßs = P?-ß(s),
where P?-ß(s) is the pressure function associated to the potential ?-ß.
Proof. Let N?-ß,s be the operator as defined in (28) with
A(a) = es(?(a)-ß), (a ? Sl).
By Theorem 4.1, the operator N?-ß,s admits a unique positive fixed
function gs ? F(Sl-1). We have seen that gs is given by
gs = lim
n?8
N n?-ß,s(1).
By the definitions of Ns and N?-ß,s, it is obvious that
N?-ß,s = e-
sß
q Ns.
By induction we get that
N n?-ß,s = e-sß(
1
q
+···+ 1
qn
)N ns .
Thus
gs = lim
n?8
N n?-ß,s(1) = e-sß(
?
8
n=1
1
qn
)?s = e
- sß
q-1?s.
Since for u ? ?1=k=l-2 Sk, gs(u) is defined by
gs(u) =
(
m-1?
j=0
gs(u, j)
) 1
q
,
we deduce that for u ? Sk with 1 = k = l- 2 we have
gs(u) = e
- sß
(q-1)ql-1-k ?s(u).
Thus
P?-ß(s) = (q - 1)ql-2 log
m-1?
j=0
gs(j) = -sß + P?(s).

Remark 5.4. Note that when ß = amin (resp. ß = amax), the function
s 7-? N?-ß,s
is increasing (resp. decreasing). Then in this case, the function s 7? gs
is also increasing (resp. decreasing) and so is the pressure function
s 7? P?-ß(s).
As an application of Theorem 5.3 and Remark 5.4 we have the fol-
lowing consequence.
Proposition 5.5. If s 7? P '?(s) is constant on R, then ? is constant
on Sl.
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 29
Proof. Suppose that P '? is constant on R. Then
P '?(s) = P '?(0) =
?
a?Sl ?(a)
ml
:= ?.
By Theorem 5.3, we have
P?(s) = ?s+ P?-?(s).
The last two equations imply that
P '?-?(s) = 0.
This is equivalent to that
m-1?
j=0
g's(j) = 0, (36)
where gs is the positive fixed point of N?-?,s. By Theorem 4.7, the
function s 7? gs is convex, so g's(j) is increasing for all j ? S. This,
with (36) imply that g's(j) is constant for all j ? S. So for every j the
function gs(j) is affine. But these functions are strictly positive on R,
they are therefore necessarily constant on R. So
g's(j) = 0, ?j ? S.
For u ? ?1=k=l-2, gs(u) is defined by the following inductive relation.
gs(u)
q =
m-1?
j=0
gs(uj), u ?
?
1=k=l-2
Sk.
Differentiating these equations, we get
qgq-1s (u)g
'
s(u) =
m-1?
j=0
g's(uj), u ?
?
1=k=l-2
Sk.
For any i ? S, since g's(i) = 0, we get
m-1?
j=0
g's(ij) = 0.
With the same argument used for proving that gs(j) is constant for all
j ? S, we can also prove that gs(ij) is constant for all (i, j) ? S2. By
induction, we can show that gs(u) are constant for all u ?
?
1=k=l-1 S
k.
By the definition of gs, for u ? Sl-1, we have
gqs(u) =
m-1?
j=0
es(?(uj)-?)gs(Tu, j). (37)
We now suppose that ? is not constant on Sl, i.e., amin < amax. Then
there exists a ? Sl such that
?(a) > ?.
30 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Let us write a = (u, j) with u ? Sl-1 and j ? S. By (37), we have
gqs(u) > e
s(?(u,j)-?)gs(Tu, j), ?s ? R.
As gs(u) and gs(Tu, j) are strictly positive constants, this is impossible
when s tend to +8. Then we conclude that ? is constant on Sl. 
5.3. Strict convexity of the pressure function.
Theorem 5.6. Suppose that amin < amax. Then
(i) P '?(s) is strictly increasing on R.
(ii) amin = P '?(-8) < P '?(+8) = afmax.
Proof. (i) P '?(s) is strictly increasing on R. We know that P
'
? is in-
creasing on R as P? is convex on R. Suppose that P '? is not strictly
increasing on R. Then there exists an interval [a, b] with a < b such
that P '? is constant on [a, b]. On the other hand, we know that P? is
analytic and so is P '?. Therefore P
'
? must be constant on the whole
line R. It is impossible by Proposition 5.5 as ? is supposed to be no
constant on Sl.
(ii) amin = P '?(-8) < P '?(+8) = amax. The strict inequality
P '?(-8) < P '?(+8) is implied by (i). Let us prove the first inequality.
The third inequality can be similarly proved. By Theorem 5.3, we have
P?(s) = amins+ P?-amin(s).
By Remark 5.4, the function s 7? P?-amin(s) is increasing. Thus we
have
P '?(s) = amin + P
'
?-amin
(s) = amin
which holds for all s ? R. Letting s? -8, we get
amin = P '?(-8).

To finish this section, we announce the following results concerning
the extremal values of P '? at infinite. Its proof will be given in Section
7.5.
Theorem 5.7. We have the equality
P '?(-8) = amin
if and only if there exists an x = (xi)
8
i=1 ? Sm such that
?(xk, xk+1, · · · , xk+l-1) = amin, ?k = 1.
We have an analogue criterion for P '?(+8) = amax.
Remark 5.8. We have a proof of three pages by combinatorially an-
alyzing P?. But we would like to give another proof in Section 7.5
(see Proposition 7.9), which is shorter, more intuitive and easier to
understand.

6. Gibbs property of Pµs
In the following we are going to establish a relation between the mass
Pµs([x
n
1 ]) and the multiple ergodic sum
?J
j=1 ?(xj · · ·xjql-1). This can
be regarded as the Gibbs property of the measure Pµs .
6.1. Dependence of the Local behavior of Pµs on ?(xj · · ·xjql-1).
There is an explicit relation between the mass Pµs([x
n
1 ]) and the mul-
tiple ergodic sum
?? n
ql-1
?
j=1 ?(xj · · ·xjql-1). Before stating this relation,
we introduce some notation.
Recall that for any integer k ? N* we denote by i(k) the unique
integer such that
k = i(k)qj , q ? i(k).
We associate to k a finite set of integers ?k defined by
?k :=
{ {i(k), i(k)q, · · · , i(k)qj} if j < l- 1
{i(k)qj-(l-1), · · · , i(k)qj} if j = l- 1.
We define ?a to be the empty set if a is not an integer. For any
sequence x = (xi)
8
i=1 ? Sm, we denote by x|?k the restriction of x on
?k.
For x ? Sm, we define
Bn(x) =
n?
j=1
?s(x|?j ).
The following basic formula is a consequence of the definitions of µs
and Pµs.
Proposition 6.1. We have
log Pµs([x
n
1 ]) = s
?
n
ql-1
??
j=1
?(xj · · ·xjql-1)-(n-?n/q?)q log?s(Ø)-qBnq (x)+Bn(x).
Proof. By the definition of Pµs , we have
logPµs([x
n
1 ]) =
?
q?i,i=n
log µs([x
n
1 |?i(n)]). (38)
However, by the definition of µs, if ??i(n) = l- 1, we have
logµs([x
n
1 |?i(n)]) =
??i(n)-1?
j=0
log
?s(xi, · · · , xiqj )
?qs(xi, · · · , xiqj-1) =
?
k??i(n)
log
?s(x|?k )
?qs(x|?k/q )
.
(39)
If ??i(n) = l, log µs([xn1 |?i(n)]) is equal to
l-2?
j=0
log
?s(xi, · · · , xiqj)
?qs(xi, · · · , xiqj-1)+
??i(n)-1?
j=l-1

in other words,
µs([x

log
?s(x|?k )
?qs(x|?k

+ s
?
k??i(n),k=n
?(x|?k ). (40)
Substituting (39) and (40) into (38), we get
log Pµs([x
n
1 ]) = S
'
n + sS
''
n (41)
where
S 'n =

S ''n =

k??i(n),k=n
?(x|?k ).
For any fixed i with q ? i, we write?
k??i(n)
log
?s(x|?k )
?qs(x|?k
q
)
=
?
k??i(n)
log?s(x|?k )- q
?
k??i(n)
log?s(x|?k
q
).
Recall that if we denote j0 = ?logq ni ? the largest integer such that
iqj0 = n, then
?i(n) = {i, iq, iq2, · · · , iqj0}.
If k = i, we have xk/q = Ø. If k = iqj with 1 = j = j0, we have
k/q = iqj-1 which belongs to ?i(n). In the following we formally write
?i(n/q) = {i, iq, iq2, · · · , iqj0-1}.
Then we can write?
k??i(n)
log
?s(x|?k )
?qs(x|?k

k??i(
n

)
?s(x|?k )-q log?s(Ø)+
?
k??i(n),kq>n
?s(x|?k ).
Notice that there is only one term in the last sum, which corresponds
to k = iqj0 . Now we take sum over i to get
S 'n = (1- q)
?
k=n
q
?s(x|?k )- q(n- ?n/q?) log?s(Ø) +
?

because ?{i = n, q ? i} = n- ?n/q? and?
i=n,q?i

k??i(

?s(x|?k ) =
?
k=n
q
?s(x|?k ),
?
i=n,q?i
?
k??i(n),kq>n
?s(x|?k ) =
?
k>n
q
?s(x|?k ).
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 33
Recall that Bn(x) =
?n
j=1 ?s(x|?j ). We can rewrite
(1- q)
?
k=n
q
?s(x|?k ) +
?
k>n
q
?s(x|?k ) = -q
?
k=n
q
?s(x|?k ) +
?
k=n
?s(x|?k )
= -qBn
q
(x) +Bn(x).
Thus
S 'n = -q(n- ?n/q?) log?s(Ø)- qBnq (x) +Bn(x).
On the other hand, we have
S ''n =
?
q?i,i=n

k??i(n),k=n
?(x|?k ) =

k=n
?(x|?k ) =

Substituting these expressions of S 'n and S

result. 
7. Proof of theorem 1.1: computation of dimH E(a)
We will use the measure Pµs to estimate the dimensions of levels sets
E(a). Actually, for a given a, there is some s such that Pµs is a nice
Frostman type measure sitting on E(a). First of all, let us calculate
the local dimensions of Pµs .
7.1. Upper bounds of local dimensions of Pµs on level sets. We
define
E+(a) :=
{
x ? Sm : lim sup
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) = a
}
,
and
E-(a) :=
{
x ? Sm : lim inf
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) = a
}
.
It is clear that
E(a) = E+(a) n E-(a).
In this subsection we will obtain upper bounds for local dimensions
of Pµs on the sets E
+(a) and E-(a). The following elementary result
will be useful for the estimation of local dimensions of Pµs .
Lemma 7.1. Let (an)n=1 be a bounded sequence of non-negative real
numbers. Then
lim inf
n?8
(
a?n/q? - an
) = 0.
34 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Proof. Let bl = aql-1-aql = a ql
q
-aql for l ? N*. Then the boundedness
implies
lim
l?8
b1 + · · ·+ bl
l
= lim
l?8
a1 - aql
l
= 0.
This in turn implies lim inf l?8 bl = 0 so that
lim inf
l?8
(
a?n/q? - an
) = lim inf
l?8
bl = 0.

Proposition 7.2. For every x ? E+(a), we have
?s = 0, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
For every x ? E-(a), we have
?s = 0, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
Consequently, for every x ? E(a), we have
?s ? R, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
Proof. The proof is based on Proposition 6.1, which implies that for
any x ? Sm and any n = 1 we have
- log Pµs([x
n
1 ])
n
= - s
n

Bn

- Bn(x)

.
Since the function ?s is bounded, so is the sequence (Bn(x)/n)n. Then,
by Lemma 7.1, we have
lim inf
n?8
Bn
q
(x)
n
q
- Bn(x)

Therefore
D(Pµs , x) = lim inf

??
j=1
?(xj · · ·xjql-1) + (q - 1) logm ?s(Ø).

so that
D(Pµs , x) = -
as
ql-1 logm
+ (q - 1) logm ?s(Ø) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
,
where the last equation is due to
P (s) = (q - 1)ql-2 log
?
j?Sl
?s(j) = (q - 1)ql-2q log?s(Ø).
By an analogue argument, we can prove the same result for x ?
E-(a) and s = 0. 
7.2. Range of L?. Recall that L? is the set of a such that E(a) 6= Ø.
Proposition 7.3. We have L? ? [P '?(-8), P '?(+8)].
Proof. We prove it by contradiction. Suppose that E(a) 6= Ø for some
a < P '?(-8). Let x = (xi)8i=1 ? E(a). Then by Proposition 7.2, we
have
lim inf
n?8
- logm Pµs([xn1 ])
n
= P?(s)- as
ql-1 logm
, ?s ? R. (42)
On the other hand, by the mean value theorem, we have
P?(s)-as = P?(s)-P?(0)-as+P?(0) = P '?(?s)s-as+P?(0) (43)
for some real number ?s between 0 and s. As P? is convex, P
'
? is
increasing on R. If we assume s < 0, then we have
P '?(?s)s-as+P?(0) = P '?(-8)s-as+P?(0) =
(
P '?(-8)- a
)
s+P?(0).
As P '?(-8) - a > 0, we deduce from (43) that for s small enough
(close to -8), we have P?(s) - as < 0. Then by (42), for s small
enough we obtain
lim inf
n?8
- logm Pµs([xn1 ])
n
< 0
which implies Pµs([x
n
1 ]) > 1 for an infinite number of n’s. This is a
contradiction to the fact that Pµ is a probability measure on Sm. Thus
we have prove that for a such that E(a) 6= Ø, we have a = P '(-8).
Similarly we can also prove a = P '(+8). 
As we shall show, we will have the equality L? = [P
'
?(-8), P '?(+8)].
36 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
7.3. Upper bounds of Hausdorff dimensions of level sets. A
upper bound of the Hausdorff dimensions of levels set is a direct conse-
quence of the Billingsley lemma and of Proposition 7.2. The Billingsley
lemma is stated as follows.
Lemma 7.4 (see Prop.4.9 in [7]). Let E be a Borel set in Sm and let
? be a finite Borel measure on Sm.
(i) We have dimH(E) = d if ?(E) > 0 and D(?, x) = d for ?-a.e x.
(ii) We have dimH(E) = d if D(?, x) = d for all x ? E.
Recall that
P *?(a) = inf
s?R
(P?(s)- as).
Proposition 7.5. For any a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(0)), we have
dimH E
+(a) = inf
s=0
1
ql-1 logm
[-as+ P?(s)]
For any a ? (P '?(0), P '?(+8)), we have
dimH E
-(a) = inf
s=0
1
ql-1 logm
[-as+ P?(s)]
In particular, we have
dimH E(a) =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
7.4. Ruelle type formula. This subsection is mainly devoted to prov-
ing the following identity which was announced in Theorem 5.1.
(q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = P '?(s).
This formula will be useful for estimating the lower bounds of dimH E(a).
We need to do some preparations for proving this result. First of all,
we deduce some identities concerning the functions ?s.
Recall that ?s(a) are defined for a ?
?
1=k=l-1 S
k. They verify the
following equations. For a ? Sl-1, we have
?qs(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?s(Ta, b)
and for a ? Sk (1 = k = l- 2) we have
?qs(a) =
?
b?S
?s(a, b).
Differentiating the two sides of each of the above two equations with
respect to s, we get for all a ? Sl-1
q?q-1s (a)?
'
s(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?(a, b)?s(Ta, b) +
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 37
and for all a ? ?1=k=l-2 Sk
q?q-1s (a)?
'
s(a) =
?
b?S
?'s(a, b).
Dividing these equations by ?qs(a) (for different a respectively), we get
Lemma 7.6. For any a ? Sl-1, we have
q
?'s(a)
?s(a)
=
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?(a, b)?s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
+
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
, (44)
and for any a ? ?1=k=l-2 Sk
q
?'s(a)
?s(a)
=
?
b?S
?'s(a, b)
?s(a, b)
. (45)
We denote
w(a) =
?'s(a)
?s(a)
, v(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
, (?a ? Sl-1).
Then we have the following identities.
Lemma 7.7. For any n ? N, we have
Eµs?(x
n+l-1
n ) = qEµsw(x
n+l-2
n )- Eµsv(xn+l-2n ), (?n = 0). (46)
Eµsw(x
n+l-2
n ) = Eµsv(x
n+l-3
n-1 ), (?n = 1). (47)
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) =
1
q(q - 1)P
'
?(s). (48)
Proof. The Markov property of µs can be stated as follows (see(34))
µs([x
n+l-1
0 ]) = µs([x
n+l-2
0 ])Qs(x
n+l-1
n )
where
Qs(x
n+l-1
n ) =
es?(x
n+l-1
n )?s(x
n+l-1
n+1 )
?qs(xn+l-2n )
.
By the Markov property, we have
Eµs?(x
n+l-1
n ) =
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-1
µs([x
n+l-1
0 ])?(x
n+l-1
n )
=
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-2
µs([x
n+l-2

?
xn+l-1
Qs(x

n )?(x

However, by the definition of Qs and using (44), it is straightforward
to check that?
xn+l-1
Qs(x
n+l-1
n )?(x
n+l-1
n ) = qw(x
n+l-2
n )- v(xn+l-2n ).
So (46) is a combination of the above two equations.
To obtain (47), we still use the Markov property of µs, to get

Now let us treat (48). First of all, by the definition of w and µs we
get
?'s(x
l-3
0 ) =
?
xl-2
?'s(x
l-2
0 ),
hence
Eµsw(x
l-2

?
x0,··· ,xl-2
µs([x

l-2

=

?
xl-2
?'s(x
l-2
0 )
?s(x
l-3
0 )
.
By (45), the last sum is equal to q
?'s(x
l-3
0 )
?s(x
l-3
0 )
. So
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) = q

µs([x

?'s(x

?s(x

.
Repeating the same argument, we obtain by induction on j that

Now, we can prove the Ruelle type formula which was announced in
Theorem 5.1. We restate it as the following proposition.

Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) =

Then by (47) in Lemma 7.7, we have

7.5. When P '?(-8) = amin and when P '?(+8) = amax. We now
give the proof of the statement announced in Theorem 5.7 concerning
the extremal values of P '? at infinity.
Theorem 7.9. We have the equality
P '?(-8) = amin
if and only if there exist an x = (xi)
8
i=0 ? Sm such that
?(xk, xk+1, · · · , xk+l-1) = amin, ?k = 0.
We have an analogue criterion for P '?(+8) = amax.
Proof. We give the proof of the criterion for P '?(-8) = amin, the one
for P '?(+8) = amax is similar.
(1). Sufficient condition. Suppose that there exists a (zj)
8
j=0 ? Sm
such that
?(zj , · · · , zj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
We are going to prove that P '?(-8) = amin. By Theorem 5.6 (ii), we
have P '?(-8) = amin, thus we only need to show that P '?(-8) = amin.
Actually we only need to find a (xj)
8
j=1 ? Sm such that
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
j=1
?(xj , · · · , xjql-1) = amin,
then by Proposition 7.3, amin ? [P '?(-8), P '?(+8)], so P '?(-8) =
amin. We can do this by choosing the sequence (xj)
8
j=1 =
?
i=1, q?i(xiqj )
8
j=0
with
(xiqj )
8
j=0 = (zj)
8
j=0.
(2). Necessary condition. Suppose that there is no (xj)
8
j=0 ? Sm
such that
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
We are going to show that there exists an o > 0 such that
P '?(s) = amin + o, ?s ? R.
And this will imply that P '?(-8) = amin + o.
From the hypothesis, we deduce that there exist no words xn+l-10
with n = ml such that
?(xj, · · · , xj+l-1) = amin, ?0 = j = n. (49)
Indeed, as xj+l-1j ? Sl for all 0 = j = n there are at most ml choices
for xj+l-1j . So for any word x
n+l-1
0 with n = ml, there exist at least
two j1, j2 ? {0, · · · , n} such that
xj1+l-1j1 = x
j2+l-1
j2
.
Then if the word xn+l-10 satisfies (49), the infinite sequence
(yj)
8
j=0 = (xj1 , · · · , xj2-1)8
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 41
would verify that
?(yj, · · · , yj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
This is a contradicts the hypothesis. We conclude then that for any
word xm
l+l-1
0 ? Sml+l-1 there exists at lest one 0 = j = ml such that
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = a'min > amin
where a'min is the second smallest value of ? over S
l, i.e., a'min =
mina?Sl{?(a) : ?(a) > amin}.
We deduce from the above discussions that for any (xj)
8
j=0 ? Sm and
any k = 0 we have
k+ml?
j=k
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = mlamin + a'min = (ml + 1)amin + d,
where we denote d = a'min - amin. This implies that for any (xj)8j=0 ?
Sm and any n = 1, we have
n-1?
j=0
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = namin +
?
n
ml + 1
?
d. (50)
Now, we will use the above inequality and Proposition 7.8 to show the
existence of an o > 0 such that
P '?(s) = amin + o, ?s ? R.
By Proposition 7.8, we have
P '?(s) = (q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1). (51)
We can rewrite the term
?k-1
j=0 Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) as
Eµs
k-1?
j=0
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1).
By (50), we have for any (xj)
8
j=0 ? Sm
k-1?
j=0
?(xj, · · · , xj+l-1) = kamin +
?
k
ml + 1
?
d.
As µs is a probability measure, we have
Eµs
k-1?
j=0
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = kamin +
?
k
ml + 1
?
d.
Substituting this in (51), we get

7.6. Lower bounds of dimH E(a). First, as an easy application of
Proposition 7.8, we get the following formula for dimH Pµs .
Proposition 7.10. For any s ? R, we have
dimH Pµs =
1
ql-1
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)].
Proof. By Proposition 6.1, we have
- log Pµs([x

Applying the law of large numbers to the function ?s, we get the

. So
lim

Bn

j=1
?(xj · · ·xjql-1) =


By Proposition 7.8, Proposition 7.10 and Billingsley’s lemma (Lemma
7.4) we get the following lower bound for dimH E(P
'
?(s)).
Proposition 7.11. For any s ? R, we have
dimH E(P
'
?(s)) =
1
ql-1 logm
[-aP '?(s) + P?(s)].
By the above proposition and Proposition 7.5 we obtain the fol-
lowing theorem about the exact Hausdorff dimension of dimH(a) for
a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(+8)).
Theorem 7.12. (i) If a = P '?(sa) for some sa ? R, then
dimH E(a) =
1
ql-1 logm
[-P '?(sa)sa + P?(sa)] =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
(ii) For a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(0)], we have
dimH E
+(a) = dimH E(a).
For a ? [P '?(0), P '?(+8)), we have
dimH E
-(a) = dimH E(a).
7.7. Dimension of level sets corresponding to the extreme points
in L?. So far, we have calculated dimH E(a) for a in (P
'
?(-8), P '?(+8)).
Now we turn to the case when a = P '?(-8) or P '?(+8). The aim of
this subsection is to prove the following result.
Theorem 7.13. If a = P '?(-8) or P '?(+8), then E(a) 6= Ø and
dimH E(a) =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
We will give the proof of Theorem 7.13 for a = P '?(-8). The proof
for a = P '?(-8) is similar.

7.7.1. Accumulation points of µs when s tends to -8. We view the
vector ps defined by (33) and the matrix Qs defined by (34) as func-
tions of s taking values in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. As all
components of ps and Qs are non-negative and bounded by 1, the set
{(ps, Qs), s ? R} is pre-compact in a Euclidean space. So there exists
a sequence (sn)n?N of real numbers with limn?8 sn = -8 such that
the limits
lim
n?8
psn , lim
n?8
Qsn
exist. Using these limits as initial law and transition probability, we
construct a (l- 1)-step Markov measure which we denote by µ-8. It
is clear that the Markov measure µsn corresponding to psn and Qsn
converges to µ-8 with respect to the weak-star topology.
Proposition 7.14. We have
Pµ-8(E(P
'
?(-8))) = 1.
In particular, E(P '?(-8)) 6= Ø.
Proof. First, we introduce a functional on the space of probability mea-
sures which is defined by
M(?) = (q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
E??(xj , · · · , xj+l-1).
The function ? 7?M(?) is continuous, just because ? 7? E??(xj , · · · , xj+l-1)
is continuous for all j.
What we have to show is that for Pµ-8-a.e. x ? Sm we have
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, · · · , xkql-1) = P '?(-8).
By Theorem 2.6, for Pµ-8-a.e. x ? Sm the limit in the left hand side
of the above equation equals to M(µ-8). As M is continuous and µsn
converges to µ-8 when n? 8, we deduce that
lim
n?8
M(µsn) = M(µ-8).
By Proposition 7.8, we know that
M(µsn) = P
'
?(sn).
So
M(µ-8) = lim
n?8
P '?(sn).
By Theorem 4.7, the map s? P '?(s) is increasing, thus we deduce that
the above limit exists and
M(µ-8) = P
'
?(-8).
This implies the desired result.

Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 45
We have the following formula for dimH Pµ-8 .
Proposition 7.15. We have
dimH Pµ-8 = lim
s?-8
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]
ql-1 logm
=
P *?(P
'
?(-8))
ql-1 logm
.
Proof. By Proposition 3.1, we know for any probability measure ? we
have
dimH P? =
(q - 1)2
logm
8?
k=1
Hk(?)
qk+1
.
As the series in the right hand side converges uniformly on ?, the map
? ? dimH P? is continuous. Since µsn converges to µ-8 when n? 8,
we deduce that
lim
n?8
dimH Pµsn = dimH Pµ-8 .
By Proposition 7.10, we have
dimH Pµs =
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]
ql-1 logm
.
The derivative of the map s? dimH Pµs is
d
ds
dimH Pµs =
-sP ''?(s)
ql-1 logm
.
As P?(s) is convex on R, P ''?(s) is non-negative, so for s = 0 the map
s? dimH Pµs
is increasing. Thus
dimH Pµ-8 = lim
n?8
dimH Pµsn = lims?-8
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]
ql-1 logm
.

Proposition 7.16.
dimH E(P
'
?(-8)) =
P *?(P
'
?(-8))
ql-1 logm
.
Proof. By the last two propositions and Billingsley’s lemma, we get
dimH E(P
'
?(-8)) =
P *?(P
'
?(-8))
ql-1 logm
.
We now show the reverse inequality. By the definition of E+(a), we
have
E(P '?(-8))) ?
?
a?(P '?(-8),P
'
?(0)]
E+(a) =
?
s=0
E+(P '?(s)).
So
dimH E(P
'
?(-8))) = dimH E+(P '?(s)) = dimH E(P '?(s)) = dimH Pµs , ?s = 0.

8. The invariant part of E(a)
From classical dynamical system point of view, the set E(a) is not
invariant and its dimension can not be described by invariant mea-
sures supported on it, as we shall see. Let us first examine the largest
dimension of ergodic measures supported on the set E(a).
Here we can consider a more general setting. Let f1, f2, · · · , fl be
real functions defined on Sm. Let
Mf1,··· ,fl(x) = limn?8
1
n
n?
k=1
f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx) · · · fl(T lkx) (53)
if the limit exists. In this section, for a real number a, we define
E(a) = {x ? Sm : Mf1,··· ,fl(x) = a}.
In order to describe the invariant part of E(a), we introducing the
so-called invariant spectrum:
Finv(a) = sup {dimµ : µ ergodic, µ(E(a)) = 1 } .
In general, Finv(a) is smaller than dimE(a). It is even possible that
no ergodic measure is supported on E(a).
Theorem 8.1. Let l = 2. Let f1 and f2 be two Ho¨lder continuous
functions on Sm. If E(a) supports an ergodic measure, then
Finv(a) = sup
{
dimµ : µ ergodic,
?
f1dµ
?
f2dµ = a
}
.
Proof. Let µ be an ergodic measure such that µ(E(a)) = 1. Then
a = lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
Eµ[f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx)]
= lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
Eµ[f1(x)f2(T
kx)]
= Eµ[f1(x)Mf2(x)]
where the first and third equalities are due to Lebesgue convergence
theorem and the second one is due to the invariance of µ. Since µ is
ergodic, Mf2(x) = Eµf2 for µ-a.e. x. So, a = Eµf1Eµf2. It follows that
Finv(a) = sup {dimµ : µ ergodic,Eµf1Eµf2 = a } .
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 47
To obtain the inverse inequality, it suffices to observe from standard
higher–dimensional multifractal analysis for Ho¨lder continuous func-
tions that the above supremum is attained by a Gibbs measure ? which
is mixing and that the mixing property implies Mf1,f2(x) = E?f1E?f2
?-a.e.. 
Remark 8.2. In the above theorem, the assumption that µ is ergodic
can be relaxed to µ is invariant. In fact, if ? is an invariant mea-
sure such that ?(E(a)) = 1. Then, by the ergodic decomposition the-
orem and the corresponding decomposition of entropy (a theorem due
to Jacobs), there is an ergodic measure µ such that µ(E(a)) = 1 and
h? = hµ. When l = 3, the result in above theorem remains true if we
replace “ergodic” by “multiple mixing”, i.e.
Fmix(a) = sup {dimµ : µ multiple mixing, Eµf1 · · ·Eµfl = a } ,
where
Fmix(a) = sup {dimµ : µ multiple mixing, µ(E(a)) = 1 } .
Here is a remarkable corollary of the above theorem. Assume that
f1 = f2 = f . If µ(E(a) = 1 for some ergodic measure µ, then we must
have
a =
(?
fdµ
)2
= 0.
There are examples of f taking negative value such that for some a < 0
we have dimE(a) > 0. However, the theorem together with the re-
mark shows that there is no invariant measure with positive dimension
supported by E(a). See Example 2 below.
In the proof of the theorem, the fact that Mf1 is almost constant
plays an important role. It is not the case for Mf1,f2. So we can not
generalize the theorem to l = 3.
For f1, f2 ? L2(µ) where µ is an ergodic measure, Bourgain proved
that Mf1,f2(x) exists for µ-almost all x. The limit is in general not
constant, but can be written by the Kronecker factor (Z,m, S), which
is considered as a rotation on a compact abelian group Z. Let p be the
factor map. Let
f˜i = E(fi|Z).
Then µ-almost surely
Mf1,f2(x) =
?
Z
f˜1(p(x) + z)f˜1(p(x) + 2z)dm(z).
Then it is easy to deduce that Mf1,f2(x) is µ-almost surely constant if
and only if
?? ? Z^ with ? 6= 1, ^˜f1(?) ^˜f2(?2) = 0.
This condition is extremely strong if µ is not weakly mixing. In other
words, when l = 3, it would be exceptional that E(a) carries an ergodic
48 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
measure which is not weakly mixing. When µ is mixing, we have
Mf1,f2(x) =
?
f1dµ
?
f2dµ for µ-almost all x.
For three or more functions, the existence of the almost everywhere
limit Mf1,f2,··· ,fl is not yet proved. But the L
2-convergence is proved
by Host and Kra [17]. The limit can be written as a similar integral,
but the integral is taken over a nilmanifold of order 2 [5].
Let us also remark that the supremum in the theorem is also equal
to the dimension of the a-level set of
lim
n?8

The motivation of the subject initiated in [10] is the following exam-
ple. The Riesz product method used in [10] doesn’t work for this case.
However Theorem 1.1 does.
Example 1. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? the potential given by
?(x, y) = x1y1 with x = (xi)
8
i=1, y = (yi)
8
i=1 ? S2. So
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[
0 0
0 1
]
.
The system of equations (5) in this case becomes
?s(0)
2 = ?s(0) + ?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = ?s(0) + e
s?s(1).
Fix s ? R. By solving an fourth order algebraic equation, we get the
unique positive solution of the above system:
?s(0) =
1
6
a(s) +
2/3- 2es
a(s)
+
2
3
,
?s(1) = ?s(0)
2 - ?s(0),
where
a(s) =
(
100- 36es + 12
v
69- 54es - 3e2s - 12e3s
) 1
3
.
Recall that the pressure function is equal to
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)).
The minimal and maximal values of ? are 0 and 1, which are respec-
tively attained by the sequences (xj)
8
j=0 = (0)
8 and (yj)
8
j=0 = (1)
8 in
the sense of
?(xj , xj+1) = 0, ?(yj, yj+1) = 1, ?j = 0.

Figure 1. The graphs of the spectrum a 7? dimH E(a)
and a 7? Finv(a) (Example 1).
Then by Theorem 1.2, we have
P '?(-8) = 0, P '?(+8) = 1.
Therefore, according to Theorem 1.1, for any a ? [0, 1] we have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 log 2
,
where sa is the unique real such that P
'
?(sa) = a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). As ?(x, y) =
f(x)f(y) with f(x) = x1, by Theorem 8.1, we have
Finv(a) = sup
{
hµ
log 2
: µ ? Minv(S2),
?
x1dµ =
v
a
}
.
It is well known (see [9]) that the right hand side, which is attained by
a Bernoulli measure, is equal to
H(
v
a) = -va log2
v
a- (1-va) log2(1-
v
a).
So
Finv(a) = H(
v
a).
See Figure 1 for the graphs of the spectra a 7? dimH E(a) and
a 7? Linv(a). We remark that, except at the extremal points (a = 1/4
or 1), we have a strict inequality Finv(a) < dimH E(a). This shows
that the invariant part of E(a) is much smaller than E(a) itself. This
is different of the classical ergodic theory (l = 1) where in general we
have Finv(a) = dimH E(a) for all a and actually E(a) is invariant.
The following example is a special case of a situation studied in [10].
So, the result is not new. Applying Theorem 1.1 only provides a second
way to get it. But when we compare its invariant spectrum with its
multifractal spectrum we will discover a new phenomenon–there is ”no”
invariant part in E(a) for some a.
50 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Example 2. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? be the potential given by
?(x, y) = (2x1 - 1)(2x2 - 1). So
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[
1 -1
-1 1
]
.
The system of equations (5) in this case reduces to
?s(0)
2 = es?s(0) + e
-s?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = e-s?s(0) + e
s?s(1).
Because of the symmetry of ?, it is easy to find the unique positive
solution of the system:
?s(0) = ?s(1) = e
s + e-s.
Thus we get the pressure function
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)) = log 2 + log(e
s + e-s).
It is evident that
P '?(s) =
es - e-s
es + e-s
.
and
P '?(-8) = -1, P '?(+8) = 1.
So, by Theorem 1.1, we have L? = [-1, 1], and for any a ? [-1, 1] we
have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 log 2
,
where sa is such that
esa - e-sa
esa + e-sa
= a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). We have ?(x, y) =
f(x)f(y) with f(x) = 2x1 - 1, then by Theorem 8.1, we have
Finv(a) = sup
{
hµ
log 2
: µ ? Minv(S2),
(?
(2x1 - 1)dµ
)2
= a
}
.
We see that we must assume a = 0. As ? (2x1 - 1)dµ = 2 ? x1dµ- 1,
the condition
(?
(2x1 - 1)dµ
)2
= a means
?
x1dµ =
1
2
(1 ± va). The
above supremum is attained by a Bernoulli measure determined by the
probability vector ((1 +
v
a)/2, (1-va)/2). In other word,
Finv(a) = H
(
1 +
v
a
2
)
where H(x) = -x log2 x- (1- x) log2(1- x).
See Figure 2 for the graphs of the spectra a 7? dimH E(a) and
a 7? Finv(a). We see that, except at the extremal point a = 0, we have
Finv(a) < dimH E(a). Moreover, for -1 = a < 0, we have Finv(a) = 0.
That is to say, there is no invariant measure with positive dimension
sitting on E(a) for -1 = a < 0. But dimH E(a) > 0.

The following example presents a case where the L? is strictly con-
tained in the interval [amin, amax].
Example 3. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? be the potential given by
?(x, y) = y1 - x1. In other words,
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[
0 -1
1 0
]
.
The system of equations (5) in this case reduces to
?s(0)
2 = ?s(0) + e
s?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = e-s?s(0) + ?s(1).
It is easy to find the unique positive solution of the system:
?s(0) = 1 + e
s
2 , ?s(1) = 1 + e
- s
2 .
The pressure function is then given by
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)) = log(2 + e
s
2 + e-
s
2 ).
So
P '?(s) =
1
2
es/2 - e-s/2
2 + es/2 + e-s/2
,
and
P '?(-8) = -
1
2
, P '?(+8) =
1
2
.
Remark that in this case we have
amin < P
'
?(-8) < P '?(+8) < amax.
By Theorem 1.1, we have L? = [-1/2, 1/2], and for any a ? [-1/2, 1/2]
we have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 log 2

(Example 3).
where sa is the solution of
esa/2 - e-sa/2
2 + esa/2 + e-sa/2
= 2a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). We have ?(x, y) =
f(y)-f(x) with f(x) = x1. By Lebesgue convergence theorem, for any
a ? R such that there exists an invariant measure µ with µ(E(a)) = 1
we have
a = lim

k=1
Eµ(x2k - xk) = lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
(Eµ(x2k)- Eµ(xk)) = 0.
(The last equality is due to the invariance of µ). This means that the
only a such that there is an invariant measure with positive dimension
sitting on E(a) is a = 0. The invariant spectrum then degenerates to
one point. We have Finv(0) = 1.
See Figure 3 for the graph of the spectrum a 7? dimH E(a).
We can easily solve the system (5) for a class of symmetric functions
described in the following example. The example 2 is a special case.
Example 4. Let l = 2, q = 2 andm = 2. Let ? = [?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,··· ,m-1}2
be a potential considered as a matrix. Suppose that each row of the ma-
trix is a permutation of the first row.
Recall the system of equations (5):
?s(i)
q =
m-1?
j=0
es?(i,j)?s(j), i ? {0, · · · , m- 1}.
It is straightforward to verify that the constant vector (a, · · · , a), with
a =
(
m-1?
j=0
es?(1,j)
) 1
q-1
,
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 53
is the unique positive solution of the above system (see Theorem 4.1).
The pressure function is then given by
P?(s) = log
m-1?
j=0
es?(1,j) + (q - 1) logm.
We have
P '?(s) =
?m-1
j=0 e
s?(1,j)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
s?(1,j)
.
Then
lim
s?-8
P '?(s) = lim
s?-8
?m-1
j=0 e
s(?(1,j)-amin)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
s(?(1,j)-amin)
= amin = min
j
?(1, j).
Similarly, we have
lim
s?+8
P '?(s) = amax = max
j
?(1, j).
By the hypothesis of symmetry on ?, it is easy to see that there exist
sequences (xj)
8
j=0 and (yj)
8
j=0 ? Sm such that
?(xj , xj+1) = amin, ?(yj, yj+1) = amax, ?j = 0.
Therefore, by Theorem 1.1, L? = [amin, amax], and for any a ? [amin, amax]
we have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 logm
,
where sa is the solution of?m-1
j=0 e
sa?(1,j)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
sa?(1,j)
= a.
The invariant spectrum: For a ? [amin, amax], the invariant spectrum
is attained by a Markov measure. That is to say
Finv(a) = sup
{
-
?
0=i,j=m-1
pipi,j logm pi,j :
?
0=i,j=m-1
?(i, j)pipi,j = a
}
where P = (pi,j) is a stochastic matrix and p = (p0, · · · , pm-1) is an
invariant probability vector of P , i.e. pP = p.
In the next example we show that in general the invariant spectrum
can be strictly larger than the mixing spectrum for some level set E(a).
Example 5. Let m = 2. Consider two functions f and h on Sm
defined by
f(i) =
{
1 0 = i < m- 1
2 i = m- 1 h(i) =
{
-2 0 = i < m- 1
1 i = m- 1 .

E(0) =
{
x ? Sm : lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
f(xk)f(x2k)h(x3k) = 0
}
.
(That means f(x, y, z) = f(x)f(y)h(z)). We claim that Fmix(0) <
Finv(0) for m = 49.
Let dj denotes the Dirac measure at j ? {0, 1, · · · , m- 1}. Let
? =
1
m- 1
m-2?
j=0
dj.
We note that ? restricted on Sm-1 gives rise to the measure of maximal
dimension on Sm-1. We consider a probability measure on Sm defined
by
µ =
1
2
µ1 +
1
2
µ2,
where
µ1([x1x2 · · ·xn]) =
?n-1
2
??
k=0
dm-1(x2k+1) ·

?n-1
2
??
k=0
?(x2k+1) ·
?n
2
??
k=1
dm-1(x2k).
Note that T-1 ? µ1 = µ2 and T-1 ? µ2 = µ1. So µ is shift invariant.
The measure µ sits on the set A = A1
?
A2 where
A1 = {x ? Sm : x2k+1 = m- 1, x2k 6= m- 1, k ? N} ,
A2 = {x ? Sm : x2k = m- 1, x2k+1 6= m- 1, k ? N} .
Actually µ1(A1) = 1 and µ2(A2) = 1 and the sets A1 and A2 are
disjoint.
We claim that µ is ergodic but not mixing. To see that µ is not
mixing, we only need to observe that T-1A1 = A2 and T
-1A2 = A1.
From this and that A1 and A2 are disjoint we deduce that
µ
(
T-2kA1 n A2
)
= 0, ?k ? N.
This implies that µ is not mixing. The ergodicity of µ with respect to T
is due to the fact that µ1 and µ2 are ergodic with respect to T
2 = T ?T
and that they are supported by disjoint sets.
For every x ? A1 we have
lim
n?8

Let us compute the dimension of µ by computing the local entropy
at typical points. If x ? A then
µ([x1 · · ·x2n]) = (m- 1)-n.
Since µ(A) = 1 this implies that dimH µ =
1
2
log(m - 1). So that
Finv(0) = 12 log(m-1). On the other hand, by Theorem 8.1 and Remark
8.2, we have
Fmix(0) = sup
{
hµ : µ-multiple mixing,
?
Sm
h dµ = 0
}
since f is strictly positive. From standard multifractal analysis we
know that the supremum is attained by a Bernoulli measure and
Fmix(0) = max

If m > 48 we conclude Finv(0) > Fmix(0).
10. Remarks and Problems
Multiplicatively invariant sets. The first basic example (Example 1
above) which motivated our study leads to the set
X2 = {(xk)k=1 ? S2 : ?k = 1, xkx2k = 0}
which was introduced in [10]. It is known to Fu¨rstenberg [15] that
any shift-invariant closed set has its Hausdorff dimension equal to its
Minkowski (box-counting) dimension. Unfortunately the closed set
X2 is not shift-invariant. Its Minkowski dimension was computed by
Fan, Liao and Ma [10] and its Hausdorff dimension was computed by
Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak [18]. The results show that the Hausdorff
dimension is smaller than the Minkowski dimension. Recall that
dimM X2 = 0.82429..., dimH X2 = 0.81137...
As observed by Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak, the set X2 is invariant
under the action of the semigroup N in the sense that TrX2 ? X2 for
all r ? N where Tr is defined by
x = (xk)k=1 7? Trx = (xrk)k=1.
56 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
As observed by Fan, Liao and Ma, we have the decomposition
N =
?
i:odd
i?
where ? = {1, 2, 22, 23, · · · } is the (multiplicative) sub-semigroup gen-
erated by 2. This is one of the key point in the present study. A
similar decomposition holds for semigroups generated by a finite num-
ber of prime numbers. Using this decomposition, Peres, Schmeling,
Solomyak and Seuret [23] computed the Hausdorff dimension and the
Minkowski dimension of sets like
X2,3 = {(xk)k=1 ? S2 : ?k = 1, xkx2kx3k = 0}.
This is an important step.
A generalization. Combining the ideas in [23] and those in the
present paper, we can study the following limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, x2k, x3k).
See [25]. Notice that the computation in this case are more involved.
Also notice that, by chance, the Riesz product method used in [10] is
well adapted to the study of the special limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
(2xk - 1)(2x2k - 1) · · · (2xlk - 1)
where l = 2 is any integer.
Vector valued potential. We indicate here how to extend our results
to vector valued potentials. First, let ?, ? be 2 functions defined on Sl
taking real values. Instead of considering the transfer operator Ls as
defined in (4), we consider the following one.
Ls?(a) =
?
j?S
es?(a,j)+?(a,j)?(Ta, j), a ? Sl-1, s ? R.
Still by Theorem 4.1, there exists a unique solution to the equation
(Ls?)
1
q = ?.
Then, we can similarly define the pressure function as indicated in (6)
and (7). We denote this pressure function by P?,?(s). The arguments
with which we proved the analyticity and convexity of s 7? P?(s) can
be also used to prove the same results for s 7? P?,?(s).
Let ? = (?1, · · · , ?d) be a function defined on Sl taking values in Rd.
For s = (s1, · · · , sd) ? Rd, we consider the following transfer operator.
Ls?(a) =
?
j?S
e<s,?>?(Ta, j), a ? Sl-1,
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 57
where <·, ·> denotes the scalar product in Rd. We denote the associated
pressure function by P (?)(s). Then, by the above discussion, for any
vectors u, v ? Rd the function
R ? s 7-? P (?)(us+ v)
is analytical and convex. We deduce from this that the function
s 7-? P (?)(s)
is infinitely differentiable and convex on Rd. We can prove that P (?)(s)
is indeed analytical by the same argument used to prove the analyticity
of P?(s).
Similarly, we define the level sets E(a) (a ? Rd) of ?. A vector
version of Theorem 1.1 is stated by just replacing the derivative of the
pressure function by gradient.
We finish the paper with two problems.
Subshifts of finite type. Our study is strictly restricted to the full
shift dynamics. It is a challenging problem to study the dynamics of
subshift of finite type.
More general are dynamics with Markov property. More efforts are
needed to deal with ß-shift which are not Markovian. New ideas are
needed to deal with these dynamics.
Nonlinear cookie cutter. The full shift is essentially the doubling
dynamics Tx = 2x mod 1 on the interval [0, 1). Cookie cutters are
the first interval maps coming into the mind after the doubling map.
If the cookie cutter maps are not linear, it is a difficult problem.
Based on the computation made in [22], Liao and Rams [21] con-
sidered a special piecewise linear map of two branches defined on two
intervals I0 and I1 and studied the following limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
1I1(T
kx)1I1(T
2kx).
The techniques presented in the present paper can be used to treat the
problem for general piecewise linear cookie cutter dynamics [12, 25].

7. Proof of theorem 1.1: computation of dimH E(a)
We will use the measure Pµs to estimate the dimensions of levels sets
E(a). Actually, for a given a, there is some s such that Pµs is a nice
Frostman type measure sitting on E(a). First of all, let us calculate
the local dimensions of Pµs .
7.1. Upper bounds of local dimensions of Pµs on level sets. We
define
E+(a) :=
{
x ? Sm : lim sup
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) = a
}
,
and
E-(a) :=
{
x ? Sm : lim inf
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, xkq, · · · , xkql-1) = a
}
.
It is clear that
E(a) = E+(a) n E-(a).
In this subsection we will obtain upper bounds for local dimensions
of Pµs on the sets E
+(a) and E-(a). The following elementary result
will be useful for the estimation of local dimensions of Pµs .
Lemma 7.1. Let (an)n=1 be a bounded sequence of non-negative real
numbers. Then
lim inf
n?8
(
a?n/q? - an
) = 0.
34 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Proof. Let bl = aql-1-aql = a ql
q
-aql for l ? N*. Then the boundedness
implies
lim
l?8
b1 + · · ·+ bl
l
= lim
l?8
a1 - aql
l
= 0.
This in turn implies lim inf l?8 bl = 0 so that
lim inf
l?8
(
a?n/q? - an
) = lim inf
l?8
bl = 0.

Proposition 7.2. For every x ? E+(a), we have
?s = 0, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
For every x ? E-(a), we have
?s = 0, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
Consequently, for every x ? E(a), we have
?s ? R, D(Pµs, x) =
P (s)- as
ql-1 logm
.
Proof. The proof is based on Proposition 6.1, which implies that for
any x ? Sm and any n = 1 we have
- log Pµs([x
n
1 ])
n
= - s

.
Since the function ?s is bounded, so is the sequence (Bn(x)/n)n. Then,
by Lemma 7.1, we have
lim inf
n?8
Bn

(x)
n

Therefore
D(Pµs , x) = lim inf

?(xj · · ·xjql-1) + (q - 1) logm ?s(Ø).

so that
D(Pµs , x) = -
as
ql-1 logm
+ (q - 1) logm ?s(Ø) =
P (s)- as

,
where the last equation is due to
P (s) = (q - 1)ql-2 log
?
j?Sl
?s(j) = (q - 1)ql-2q log?s(Ø).
By an analogue argument, we can prove the same result for x ?
E-(a) and s = 0. 
7.2. Range of L?. Recall that L? is the set of a such that E(a) 6= Ø.
Proposition 7.3. We have L? ? [P '?(-8), P '?(+8)].
Proof. We prove it by contradiction. Suppose that E(a) 6= Ø for some
a < P '?(-8). Let x = (xi)8i=1 ? E(a). Then by Proposition 7.2, we
have
lim inf
n?8
- logm Pµs([xn1 ])
n
= P?(s)- as
ql-1 logm
, ?s ? R. (42)
On the other hand, by the mean value theorem, we have
P?(s)-as = P?(s)-P?(0)-as+P?(0) = P '?(?s)s-as+P?(0) (43)
for some real number ?s between 0 and s. As P? is convex, P
'
? is
increasing on R. If we assume s < 0, then we have
P '?(?s)s-as+P?(0) = P '?(-8)s-as+P?(0) =
(
P '?(-8)- a
)
s+P?(0).
As P '?(-8) - a > 0, we deduce from (43) that for s small enough
(close to -8), we have P?(s) - as < 0. Then by (42), for s small
enough we obtain
lim inf
n?8
- logm Pµs([xn1 ])
n
< 0
which implies Pµs([x
n
1 ]) > 1 for an infinite number of n’s. This is a
contradiction to the fact that Pµ is a probability measure on Sm. Thus
we have prove that for a such that E(a) 6= Ø, we have a = P '(-8).
Similarly we can also prove a = P '(+8). 
As we shall show, we will have the equality L? = [P
'
?(-8), P '?(+8)].

7.3. Upper bounds of Hausdorff dimensions of level sets. A
upper bound of the Hausdorff dimensions of levels set is a direct conse-
quence of the Billingsley lemma and of Proposition 7.2. The Billingsley
lemma is stated as follows.
Lemma 7.4 (see Prop.4.9 in [7]). Let E be a Borel set in Sm and let
? be a finite Borel measure on Sm.
(i) We have dimH(E) = d if ?(E) > 0 and D(?, x) = d for ?-a.e x.
(ii) We have dimH(E) = d if D(?, x) = d for all x ? E.
Recall that
P *?(a) = inf
s?R
(P?(s)- as).
Proposition 7.5. For any a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(0)), we have
dimH E
+(a) = inf
s=0
1
ql-1 logm
[-as+ P?(s)]
For any a ? (P '?(0), P '?(+8)), we have
dimH E
-(a) = inf
s=0
1
ql-1 logm
[-as+ P?(s)]
In particular, we have
dimH E(a) =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
7.4. Ruelle type formula. This subsection is mainly devoted to prov-
ing the following identity which was announced in Theorem 5.1.
(q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = P '?(s).
This formula will be useful for estimating the lower bounds of dimH E(a).
We need to do some preparations for proving this result. First of all,
we deduce some identities concerning the functions ?s.
Recall that ?s(a) are defined for a ?
?
1=k=l-1 S
k. They verify the
following equations. For a ? Sl-1, we have
?qs(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?s(Ta, b)
and for a ? Sk (1 = k = l- 2) we have
?qs(a) =
?
b?S
?s(a, b).
Differentiating the two sides of each of the above two equations with
respect to s, we get for all a ? Sl-1
q?q-1s (a)?
'
s(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?(a, b)?s(Ta, b) +
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 37
and for all a ? ?1=k=l-2 Sk
q?q-1s (a)?
'
s(a) =
?
b?S
?'s(a, b).
Dividing these equations by ?qs(a) (for different a respectively), we get
Lemma 7.6. For any a ? Sl-1, we have
q
?'s(a)
?s(a)
=
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?(a, b)?s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
+
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
, (44)
and for any a ? ?1=k=l-2 Sk
q
?'s(a)
?s(a)
=
?
b?S
?'s(a, b)
?s(a, b)
. (45)
We denote
w(a) =
?'s(a)
?s(a)
, v(a) =
?
b?S
es?(a,b)?'s(Ta, b)
?qs(a)
, (?a ? Sl-1).
Then we have the following identities.
Lemma 7.7. For any n ? N, we have
Eµs?(x
n+l-1
n ) = qEµsw(x
n+l-2
n )- Eµsv(xn+l-2n ), (?n = 0). (46)
Eµsw(x
n+l-2
n ) = Eµsv(x
n+l-3
n-1 ), (?n = 1). (47)
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) =
1
q(q - 1)P
'
?(s). (48)
Proof. The Markov property of µs can be stated as follows (see(34))
µs([x
n+l-1
0 ]) = µs([x
n+l-2
0 ])Qs(x
n+l-1
n )
where
Qs(x
n+l-1
n ) =
es?(x
n+l-1
n )?s(x
n+l-1
n+1 )
?qs(xn+l-2n )
.
By the Markov property, we have
Eµs?(x
n+l-1
n ) =
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-1
µs([x
n+l-1
0 ])?(x
n+l-1
n )
=
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-2
µs([x
n+l-2
0 ])
?
xn+l-1
Qs(x
n+l-1
n )?(x
n+l-1
n ).
However, by the definition of Qs and using (44), it is straightforward
to check that?
xn+l-1
Qs(x
n+l-1
n )?(x
n+l-1
n ) = qw(x
n+l-2
n )- v(xn+l-2n ).
So (46) is a combination of the above two equations.
To obtain (47), we still use the Markov property of µs, to get
38 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Eµsw(x
n+l-2
n ) =
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-2
µs([x
n+l-2
0 ])w(x
n+l-2
n )
=
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-3
µs([x
n+l-3
0 ])
?
xn+l-2
es?(x
n+l-2
n-1 )?s(x
n+l-2
n )
?qs(x
n+l-3
n-1 )
?'s(x
n+l-2
n )
?s(xn+l-2n )
=
?
x0,··· ,xn+l-3
µs([x
n+l-3
0 ])v(x
n+l-3
n-1 ) = Eµsv(x
n+l-3
n-1 ).
Now let us treat (48). First of all, by the definition of w and µs we
get
?'s(x
l-3
0 ) =
?
xl-2
?'s(x
l-2
0 ),
hence
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) =
?
x0,··· ,xl-2
µs([x
l-2
0 ])w(x
l-2
0 )
=
?
x0,··· ,xl-3
µs([x
l-3
0 ])
?
xl-2
?'s(x
l-2
0 )
?s(x
l-3
0 )
.
By (45), the last sum is equal to q
?'s(x
l-3
0 )
?s(x
l-3
0 )
. So
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) = q
?
x0,··· ,xl-3
µs([x
l-3
0 ])
?'s(x
l-3
0 )
?s(x
l-3
0 )
.
Repeating the same argument, we obtain by induction on j that
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) = q
l-2-j
?
x0,··· ,xj
µs([x
j
0])
?'s(x
j
0)
?s(x
j

.
So finally when j = 0 we get
Eµsw(x
l-2
0 ) = q


Now, we can prove the Ruelle type formula which was announced in
Theorem 5.1. We restate it as the following proposition.
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 39
Proposition 7.8. For any s ? R, we have
(q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = P '?(s).
Proof. By (46) in Lemma 7.7, for any k ? N*, we have
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) =
k-1?
j=0
(
qEµsw(x
j+l-2
j )- Eµsv(xj+l-2j )
)
= qEµsw(x
l-2
0 ) + q
k-1?
j=1
Eµsw(x
j+l-2
j )
-
k-1?
j=0
Eµsv(x
j+l-2
j ).
Let
Sk =
k-1?
j=0
Eµsv(x
j+l-2
j ).
Then by (47) in Lemma 7.7, we have
k-1?
j=1
Eµsw(x
j+l-2
j ) = Sk-1.
Using the above equality and (48) in Lemma 7.7, we can write
k-1?
j=0
Eµs?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) =
P '?(s)
q - 1 + qSk-1 - Sk.
The facts S0 = 0 and Sk = o(k) imply
8?
k=1

qk+1
(qSk-1 - Sk) = 0.
Then
(q - 1)2

P '?(s)

which is equal to P '?(s), because
?8

40 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
7.5. When P '?(-8) = amin and when P '?(+8) = amax. We now
give the proof of the statement announced in Theorem 5.7 concerning
the extremal values of P '? at infinity.
Theorem 7.9. We have the equality
P '?(-8) = amin
if and only if there exist an x = (xi)
8
i=0 ? Sm such that
?(xk, xk+1, · · · , xk+l-1) = amin, ?k = 0.
We have an analogue criterion for P '?(+8) = amax.
Proof. We give the proof of the criterion for P '?(-8) = amin, the one
for P '?(+8) = amax is similar.
(1). Sufficient condition. Suppose that there exists a (zj)
8
j=0 ? Sm
such that
?(zj , · · · , zj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
We are going to prove that P '?(-8) = amin. By Theorem 5.6 (ii), we
have P '?(-8) = amin, thus we only need to show that P '?(-8) = amin.
Actually we only need to find a (xj)
8
j=1 ? Sm such that
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
j=1
?(xj , · · · , xjql-1) = amin,
then by Proposition 7.3, amin ? [P '?(-8), P '?(+8)], so P '?(-8) =
amin. We can do this by choosing the sequence (xj)
8
j=1 =
?
i=1, q?i(xiqj )
8
j=0
with
(xiqj )
8
j=0 = (zj)
8
j=0.
(2). Necessary condition. Suppose that there is no (xj)
8
j=0 ? Sm
such that
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
We are going to show that there exists an o > 0 such that
P '?(s) = amin + o, ?s ? R.
And this will imply that P '?(-8) = amin + o.
From the hypothesis, we deduce that there exist no words xn+l-10
with n = ml such that
?(xj, · · · , xj+l-1) = amin, ?0 = j = n. (49)
Indeed, as xj+l-1j ? Sl for all 0 = j = n there are at most ml choices
for xj+l-1j . So for any word x
n+l-1
0 with n = ml, there exist at least
two j1, j2 ? {0, · · · , n} such that
xj1+l-1j1 = x
j2+l-1
j2
.
Then if the word xn+l-10 satisfies (49), the infinite sequence
(yj)

would verify that
?(yj, · · · , yj+l-1) = amin, ?j = 0.
This is a contradicts the hypothesis. We conclude then that for any
word xm

0 ? Sml+l-1 there exists at lest one 0 = j = ml such that
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = a'min > amin
where a'min is the second smallest value of ? over S
l, i.e., a'min =
mina?Sl{?(a) : ?(a) > amin}.
We deduce from the above discussions that for any (xj)

j=0 ? Sm and
any k = 0 we have
k+ml?
j=k
?(xj , · · · , xj+l-1) = mlamin + a'min = (ml + 1)amin + d,
where we denote d = a'min - amin. This implies that for any (xj)8j=0 ?

Now, we will use the above inequality and Proposition 7.8 to show the
existence of an o > 0 such that

7.6. Lower bounds of dimH E(a). First, as an easy application of
Proposition 7.8, we get the following formula for dimH Pµs .
Proposition 7.10. For any s ? R, we have
dimH Pµs =
1
ql-1
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)].
Proof. By Proposition 6.1, we have

Applying the law of large numbers to the function ?s, we get the

By Proposition 7.8, Proposition 7.10 and Billingsley’s lemma (Lemma
7.4) we get the following lower bound for dimH E(P
'
?(s)).
Proposition 7.11. For any s ? R, we have
dimH E(P
'
?(s)) =
1
ql-1 logm
[-aP '?(s) + P?(s)].
By the above proposition and Proposition 7.5 we obtain the fol-
lowing theorem about the exact Hausdorff dimension of dimH(a) for
a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(+8)).
Theorem 7.12. (i) If a = P '?(sa) for some sa ? R, then
dimH E(a) =
1
ql-1 logm
[-P '?(sa)sa + P?(sa)] =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
(ii) For a ? (P '?(-8), P '?(0)], we have
dimH E
+(a) = dimH E(a).
For a ? [P '?(0), P '?(+8)), we have
dimH E
-(a) = dimH E(a).
7.7. Dimension of level sets corresponding to the extreme points
in L?. So far, we have calculated dimH E(a) for a in (P
'
?(-8), P '?(+8)).
Now we turn to the case when a = P '?(-8) or P '?(+8). The aim of
this subsection is to prove the following result.
Theorem 7.13. If a = P '?(-8) or P '?(+8), then E(a) 6= Ø and
dimH E(a) =
P *?(a)
ql-1 logm
.
We will give the proof of Theorem 7.13 for a = P '?(-8). The proof
for a = P '?(-8) is similar.

7.7.1. Accumulation points of µs when s tends to -8. We view the
vector ps defined by (33) and the matrix Qs defined by (34) as func-
tions of s taking values in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. As all
components of ps and Qs are non-negative and bounded by 1, the set
{(ps, Qs), s ? R} is pre-compact in a Euclidean space. So there exists
a sequence (sn)n?N of real numbers with limn?8 sn = -8 such that
the limits
lim
n?8
psn , lim
n?8
Qsn
exist. Using these limits as initial law and transition probability, we
construct a (l- 1)-step Markov measure which we denote by µ-8. It
is clear that the Markov measure µsn corresponding to psn and Qsn
converges to µ-8 with respect to the weak-star topology.
Proposition 7.14. We have
Pµ-8(E(P
'
?(-8))) = 1.
In particular, E(P '?(-8)) 6= Ø.
Proof. First, we introduce a functional on the space of probability mea-
sures which is defined by
M(?) = (q - 1)2
8?
k=1
1
qk+1
k-1?
j=0
E??(xj , · · · , xj+l-1).
The function ? 7?M(?) is continuous, just because ? 7? E??(xj , · · · , xj+l-1)
is continuous for all j.
What we have to show is that for Pµ-8-a.e. x ? Sm we have
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, · · · , xkql-1) = P '?(-8).
By Theorem 2.6, for Pµ-8-a.e. x ? Sm the limit in the left hand side
of the above equation equals to M(µ-8). As M is continuous and µsn
converges to µ-8 when n? 8, we deduce that
lim
n?8
M(µsn) = M(µ-8).
By Proposition 7.8, we know that
M(µsn) = P
'
?(sn).
So
M(µ-8) = lim
n?8
P '?(sn).
By Theorem 4.7, the map s? P '?(s) is increasing, thus we deduce that
the above limit exists and
M(µ-8) = P
'
?(-8).
This implies the desired result.

Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 45
We have the following formula for dimH Pµ-8 .
Proposition 7.15. We have
dimH Pµ-8 = lim
s?-8
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]
ql-1 logm
=
P *?(P
'

ql-1 logm

have
dimH P? =
(q - 1)2
logm
8?
k=1
Hk(?)
qk+1
.
As the series in the right hand side converges uniformly on ?, the map
? ? dimH P? is continuous. Since µsn converges to µ-8 when n? 8,
we deduce that
lim
n?8
dimH Pµsn = dimH Pµ-8 .
By Proposition 7.10, we have
dimH Pµs =
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]
ql-1 logm
.
The derivative of the map s? dimH Pµs is
d
ds
dimH Pµs =
-sP ''?(s)
ql-1 logm
.
As P?(s) is convex on R, P ''?(s) is non-negative, so for s = 0 the map
s? dimH Pµs
is increasing. Thus
dimH Pµ-8 = lim
n?8
dimH Pµsn = lims?-8
[-sP '?(s) + P?(s)]


Proposition 7.16.
dimH E(P
'
?(-8)) =
P *?(P

Proof. By the last two propositions and Billingsley’s lemma, we get
dimH E(P
'
?(-8)) =
P *?(P
'
?(-8))
ql-1 logm
.
We now show the reverse inequality. By the definition of E+(a), we
have
E(P '?(-8))) ?
?
a?(P '?(-8),P
'
?(0)]
E+(a) =
?
s=0
E+(P '?(s)).
So
dimH E(P
'
?(-8))) = dimH E+(P '?(s)) = dimH E(P '?(s)) = dimH Pµs , ?s = 0.

8. The invariant part of E(a)
From classical dynamical system point of view, the set E(a) is not
invariant and its dimension can not be described by invariant mea-
sures supported on it, as we shall see. Let us first examine the largest
dimension of ergodic measures supported on the set E(a).
Here we can consider a more general setting. Let f1, f2, · · · , fl be
real functions defined on Sm. Let
Mf1,··· ,fl(x) = limn?8
1
n
n?
k=1
f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx) · · · fl(T lkx) (53)
if the limit exists. In this section, for a real number a, we define
E(a) = {x ? Sm : Mf1,··· ,fl(x) = a}.
In order to describe the invariant part of E(a), we introducing the
so-called invariant spectrum:
Finv(a) = sup {dimµ : µ ergodic, µ(E(a)) = 1 } .
In general, Finv(a) is smaller than dimE(a). It is even possible that
no ergodic measure is supported on E(a).
Theorem 8.1. Let l = 2. Let f1 and f2 be two Ho¨lder continuous
functions on Sm. If E(a) supports an ergodic measure, then
Finv(a) = sup
{
dimµ : µ ergodic,
?
f1dµ
?
f2dµ = a
}
.
Proof. Let µ be an ergodic measure such that µ(E(a)) = 1. Then
a = lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
Eµ[f1(T
kx)f2(T
2kx)]
= lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
Eµ[f1(x)f2(T
kx)]
= Eµ[f1(x)Mf2(x)]
where the first and third equalities are due to Lebesgue convergence
theorem and the second one is due to the invariance of µ. Since µ is
ergodic, Mf2(x) = Eµf2 for µ-a.e. x. So, a = Eµf1Eµf2. It follows that
Finv(a) = sup {dimµ : µ ergodic,Eµf1Eµf2 = a } .
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 47
To obtain the inverse inequality, it suffices to observe from standard
higher–dimensional multifractal analysis for Ho¨lder continuous func-
tions that the above supremum is attained by a Gibbs measure ? which
is mixing and that the mixing property implies Mf1,f2(x) = E?f1E?f2
?-a.e.. 
Remark 8.2. In the above theorem, the assumption that µ is ergodic
can be relaxed to µ is invariant. In fact, if ? is an invariant mea-
sure such that ?(E(a)) = 1. Then, by the ergodic decomposition the-
orem and the corresponding decomposition of entropy (a theorem due
to Jacobs), there is an ergodic measure µ such that µ(E(a)) = 1 and
h? = hµ. When l = 3, the result in above theorem remains true if we
replace “ergodic” by “multiple mixing”, i.e.
Fmix(a) = sup {dimµ : µ multiple mixing, Eµf1 · · ·Eµfl = a } ,
where
Fmix(a) = sup {dimµ : µ multiple mixing, µ(E(a)) = 1 } .
Here is a remarkable corollary of the above theorem. Assume that
f1 = f2 = f . If µ(E(a) = 1 for some ergodic measure µ, then we must
have
a =
(?
fdµ
)2
= 0.
There are examples of f taking negative value such that for some a < 0
we have dimE(a) > 0. However, the theorem together with the re-
mark shows that there is no invariant measure with positive dimension
supported by E(a). See Example 2 below.
In the proof of the theorem, the fact that Mf1 is almost constant
plays an important role. It is not the case for Mf1,f2. So we can not
generalize the theorem to l = 3.
For f1, f2 ? L2(µ) where µ is an ergodic measure, Bourgain proved
that Mf1,f2(x) exists for µ-almost all x. The limit is in general not
constant, but can be written by the Kronecker factor (Z,m, S), which
is considered as a rotation on a compact abelian group Z. Let p be the
factor map. Let
f˜i = E(fi|Z).
Then µ-almost surely
Mf1,f2(x) =
?
Z
f˜1(p(x) + z)f˜1(p(x) + 2z)dm(z).
Then it is easy to deduce that Mf1,f2(x) is µ-almost surely constant if
and only if
?? ? Z^ with ? 6= 1, ^˜f1(?) ^˜f2(?2) = 0.
This condition is extremely strong if µ is not weakly mixing. In other
words, when l = 3, it would be exceptional that E(a) carries an ergodic
48 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
measure which is not weakly mixing. When µ is mixing, we have
Mf1,f2(x) =
?
f1dµ
?
f2dµ for µ-almost all x.
For three or more functions, the existence of the almost everywhere
limit Mf1,f2,··· ,fl is not yet proved. But the L
2-convergence is proved
by Host and Kra [17]. The limit can be written as a similar integral,
but the integral is taken over a nilmanifold of order 2 [5].
Let us also remark that the supremum in the theorem is also equal
to the dimension of the a-level set of
lim
n?8

n2
?
1=j,k=n
f1(T

See [11]. Also see [14], where general V -statistics are studied.
9. Examples
The motivation of the subject initiated in [10] is the following exam-
ple. The Riesz product method used in [10] doesn’t work for this case.
However Theorem 1.1 does.
Example 1. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? the potential given by
?(x, y) = x1y1 with x = (xi)
8
i=1, y = (yi)
8
i=1 ? S2. So
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[
0 0
0 1
]
.
The system of equations (5) in this case becomes
?s(0)
2 = ?s(0) + ?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = ?s(0) + e
s?s(1).
Fix s ? R. By solving an fourth order algebraic equation, we get the
unique positive solution of the above system:
?s(0) =
1
6
a(s) +
2/3- 2es
a(s)
+
2
3
,
?s(1) = ?s(0)
2 - ?s(0),
where
a(s) =
(
100- 36es + 12
v
69- 54es - 3e2s - 12e3s
) 1
3
.
Recall that the pressure function is equal to
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)).
The minimal and maximal values of ? are 0 and 1, which are respec-
tively attained by the sequences (xj)
8
j=0 = (0)
8 and (yj)
8
j=0 = (1)
8 in
the sense of
?(xj , xj+1) = 0, ?(yj, yj+1) = 1, ?j = 0.

Figure 1. The graphs of the spectrum a 7? dimH E(a)
and a 7? Finv(a) (Example 1).
Then by Theorem 1.2, we have
P '?(-8) = 0, P '?(+8) = 1.
Therefore, according to Theorem 1.1, for any a ? [0, 1] we have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 log 2
,
where sa is the unique real such that P
'
?(sa) = a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). As ?(x, y) =
f(x)f(y) with f(x) = x1, by Theorem 8.1, we have
Finv(a) = sup
{
hµ
log 2
: µ ? Minv(S2),
?
x1dµ =
v
a
}
.
It is well known (see [9]) that the right hand side, which is attained by
a Bernoulli measure, is equal to
H(
v
a) = -va log2
v
a- (1-va) log2(1-
v
a).
So
Finv(a) = H(
v
a).
See Figure 1 for the graphs of the spectra a 7? dimH E(a) and
a 7? Linv(a). We remark that, except at the extremal points (a = 1/4
or 1), we have a strict inequality Finv(a) < dimH E(a). This shows
that the invariant part of E(a) is much smaller than E(a) itself. This
is different of the classical ergodic theory (l = 1) where in general we
have Finv(a) = dimH E(a) for all a and actually E(a) is invariant.
The following example is a special case of a situation studied in [10].
So, the result is not new. Applying Theorem 1.1 only provides a second
way to get it. But when we compare its invariant spectrum with its
multifractal spectrum we will discover a new phenomenon–there is ”no”
invariant part in E(a) for some a.
50 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
Example 2. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? be the potential given by
?(x, y) = (2x1 - 1)(2x2 - 1). So
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[
1 -1
-1 1
]
.
The system of equations (5) in this case reduces to
?s(0)
2 = es?s(0) + e
-s?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = e-s?s(0) + e
s?s(1).
Because of the symmetry of ?, it is easy to find the unique positive
solution of the system:
?s(0) = ?s(1) = e
s + e-s.
Thus we get the pressure function
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)) = log 2 + log(e
s + e-s).
It is evident that
P '?(s) =
es - e-s
es + e-s
.
and
P '?(-8) = -1, P '?(+8) = 1.
So, by Theorem 1.1, we have L? = [-1, 1], and for any a ? [-1, 1] we
have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 log 2
,
where sa is such that
esa - e-sa
esa + e-sa
= a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). We have ?(x, y) =
f(x)f(y) with f(x) = 2x1 - 1, then by Theorem 8.1, we have
Finv(a) = sup
{
hµ
log 2
: µ ? Minv(S2),
(?
(2x1 - 1)dµ
)2
= a
}
.
We see that we must assume a = 0. As ? (2x1 - 1)dµ = 2 ? x1dµ- 1,
the condition
(?
(2x1 - 1)dµ
)2
= a means
?
x1dµ =
1
2
(1 ± va). The
above supremum is attained by a Bernoulli measure determined by the
probability vector ((1 +
v
a)/2, (1-va)/2). In other word,
Finv(a) = H
(
1 +
v
a
2
)
where H(x) = -x log2 x- (1- x) log2(1- x).
See Figure 2 for the graphs of the spectra a 7? dimH E(a) and
a 7? Finv(a). We see that, except at the extremal point a = 0, we have
Finv(a) < dimH E(a). Moreover, for -1 = a < 0, we have Finv(a) = 0.
That is to say, there is no invariant measure with positive dimension
sitting on E(a) for -1 = a < 0. But dimH E(a) > 0.

The following example presents a case where the L? is strictly con-
tained in the interval [amin, amax].
Example 3. Let q = 2, m = 2, l = 2 and ? be the potential given by
?(x, y) = y1 - x1. In other words,
[?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,1}2 =
[

?s(0)
2 = ?s(0) + e
s?s(1),
?s(1)
2 = e-s?s(0) + ?s(1).
It is easy to find the unique positive solution of the system:
?s(0) = 1 + e
s
2 , ?s(1) = 1 + e
- s
2 .
The pressure function is then given by
P?(s) = log(?s(0) + ?s(1)) = log(2 + e
s
2 + e-
s
2 ).
So

where sa is the solution of
esa/2 - e-sa/2
2 + esa/2 + e-sa/2
= 2a.
We now consider the invariant spectrum of E(a). We have ?(x, y) =
f(y)-f(x) with f(x) = x1. By Lebesgue convergence theorem, for any
a ? R such that there exists an invariant measure µ with µ(E(a)) = 1
we have
a = lim

Eµ(x2k - xk) = lim

n
n?
k=1
(Eµ(x2k)- Eµ(xk)) = 0.
(The last equality is due to the invariance of µ). This means that the
only a such that there is an invariant measure with positive dimension
sitting on E(a) is a = 0. The invariant spectrum then degenerates to
one point. We have Finv(0) = 1.
See Figure 3 for the graph of the spectrum a 7? dimH E(a).
We can easily solve the system (5) for a class of symmetric functions
described in the following example. The example 2 is a special case.
Example 4. Let l = 2, q = 2 andm = 2. Let ? = [?(i, j)](i,j)?{0,··· ,m-1}2
be a potential considered as a matrix. Suppose that each row of the ma-
trix is a permutation of the first row.
Recall the system of equations (5):
?s(i)
q =
m-1?
j=0
es?(i,j)?s(j), i ? {0, · · · , m- 1}.
It is straightforward to verify that the constant vector (a, · · · , a), with
a =
(
m-1?
j=0
es?(1,j)
) 1
q-1
,
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 53
is the unique positive solution of the above system (see Theorem 4.1).
The pressure function is then given by
P?(s) = log
m-1?
j=0
es?(1,j) + (q - 1) logm.
We have
P '?(s) =
?m-1
j=0 e
s?(1,j)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
s?(1,j)
.
Then
lim
s?-8
P '?(s) = lim
s?-8
?m-1
j=0 e
s(?(1,j)-amin)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
s(?(1,j)-amin)
= amin = min
j
?(1, j).
Similarly, we have
lim
s?+8
P '?(s) = amax = max
j
?(1, j).
By the hypothesis of symmetry on ?, it is easy to see that there exist
sequences (xj)
8
j=0 and (yj)
8
j=0 ? Sm such that
?(xj , xj+1) = amin, ?(yj, yj+1) = amax, ?j = 0.
Therefore, by Theorem 1.1, L? = [amin, amax], and for any a ? [amin, amax]
we have
dimH E(a) =
-asa + P?(sa)
2 logm
,
where sa is the solution of?m-1
j=0 e
sa?(1,j)?(1, j)?m-1
j=0 e
sa?(1,j)
= a.
The invariant spectrum: For a ? [amin, amax], the invariant spectrum
is attained by a Markov measure. That is to say
Finv(a) = sup
{
-
?
0=i,j=m-1
pipi,j logm pi,j :
?
0=i,j=m-1
?(i, j)pipi,j = a
}
where P = (pi,j) is a stochastic matrix and p = (p0, · · · , pm-1) is an
invariant probability vector of P , i.e. pP = p.
In the next example we show that in general the invariant spectrum
can be strictly larger than the mixing spectrum for some level set E(a).
Example 5. Let m = 2. Consider two functions f and h on Sm
defined by
f(i) =
{
1 0 = i < m- 1
2 i = m- 1 h(i) =
{
-2 0 = i < m- 1
1 i = m- 1 .

Consider the level set
E(0) =
{
x ? Sm : lim
n?8

n
n?
k=1
f(xk)f(x2k)h(x3k) = 0
}
.
(That means f(x, y, z) = f(x)f(y)h(z)). We claim that Fmix(0) <
Finv(0) for m = 49.
Let dj denotes the Dirac measure at j ? {0, 1, · · · , m- 1}. Let
? =
1
m- 1
m-2?
j=0
dj.
We note that ? restricted on Sm-1 gives rise to the measure of maximal
dimension on Sm-1. We consider a probability measure on Sm defined
by
µ =
1
2
µ1 +
1
2
µ2,
where
µ1([x1x2 · · ·xn]) =
?n-1
2
??
k=0
dm-1(x2k+1) ·
?n

and
µ2([x1x2 · · ·xn]) =
?n-1
2
??
k=0
?(x2k+1) ·
?n
2
??
k=1
dm-1(x2k).
Note that T-1 ? µ1 = µ2 and T-1 ? µ2 = µ1. So µ is shift invariant.
The measure µ sits on the set A = A1
?
A2 where
A1 = {x ? Sm : x2k+1 = m- 1, x2k 6= m- 1, k ? N} ,
A2 = {x ? Sm : x2k = m- 1, x2k+1 6= m- 1, k ? N} .
Actually µ1(A1) = 1 and µ2(A2) = 1 and the sets A1 and A2 are
disjoint.
We claim that µ is ergodic but not mixing. To see that µ is not
mixing, we only need to observe that T-1A1 = A2 and T
-1A2 = A1.
From this and that A1 and A2 are disjoint we deduce that
µ
(
T-2kA1 n A2
)
= 0, ?k ? N.
This implies that µ is not mixing. The ergodicity of µ with respect to T
is due to the fact that µ1 and µ2 are ergodic with respect to T
2 = T ?T
and that they are supported by disjoint sets.
For every x ? A1 we have
lim

Let us compute the dimension of µ by computing the local entropy
at typical points. If x ? A then
µ([x1 · · ·x2n]) = (m- 1)-n.
Since µ(A) = 1 this implies that dimH µ =
1
2
log(m - 1). So that
Finv(0) = 12 log(m-1). On the other hand, by Theorem 8.1 and Remark
8.2, we have
Fmix(0) = sup
{
hµ : µ-multiple mixing,
?
Sm
h dµ = 0
}
since f is strictly positive. From standard multifractal analysis we
know that the supremum is attained by a Bernoulli measure and
Fmix(0) = max
pi=0

If m > 48 we conclude Finv(0) > Fmix(0).
10. Remarks and Problems
Multiplicatively invariant sets. The first basic example (Example 1
above) which motivated our study leads to the set
X2 = {(xk)k=1 ? S2 : ?k = 1, xkx2k = 0}
which was introduced in [10]. It is known to Fu¨rstenberg [15] that
any shift-invariant closed set has its Hausdorff dimension equal to its
Minkowski (box-counting) dimension. Unfortunately the closed set
X2 is not shift-invariant. Its Minkowski dimension was computed by
Fan, Liao and Ma [10] and its Hausdorff dimension was computed by
Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak [18]. The results show that the Hausdorff
dimension is smaller than the Minkowski dimension. Recall that
dimM X2 = 0.82429..., dimH X2 = 0.81137...
As observed by Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak, the set X2 is invariant
under the action of the semigroup N in the sense that TrX2 ? X2 for
all r ? N where Tr is defined by
x = (xk)k=1 7? Trx = (xrk)k=1.
56 Multifractal analysis of some multiple ergodic averages
As observed by Fan, Liao and Ma, we have the decomposition
N =
?
i:odd
i?
where ? = {1, 2, 22, 23, · · · } is the (multiplicative) sub-semigroup gen-
erated by 2. This is one of the key point in the present study. A
similar decomposition holds for semigroups generated by a finite num-
ber of prime numbers. Using this decomposition, Peres, Schmeling,
Solomyak and Seuret [23] computed the Hausdorff dimension and the
Minkowski dimension of sets like
X2,3 = {(xk)k=1 ? S2 : ?k = 1, xkx2kx3k = 0}.
This is an important step.
A generalization. Combining the ideas in [23] and those in the
present paper, we can study the following limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
?(xk, x2k, x3k).
See [25]. Notice that the computation in this case are more involved.
Also notice that, by chance, the Riesz product method used in [10] is
well adapted to the study of the special limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
(2xk - 1)(2x2k - 1) · · · (2xlk - 1)
where l = 2 is any integer.
Vector valued potential. We indicate here how to extend our results
to vector valued potentials. First, let ?, ? be 2 functions defined on Sl
taking real values. Instead of considering the transfer operator Ls as
defined in (4), we consider the following one.
Ls?(a) =
?
j?S
es?(a,j)+?(a,j)?(Ta, j), a ? Sl-1, s ? R.
Still by Theorem 4.1, there exists a unique solution to the equation
(Ls?)
1
q = ?.
Then, we can similarly define the pressure function as indicated in (6)
and (7). We denote this pressure function by P?,?(s). The arguments
with which we proved the analyticity and convexity of s 7? P?(s) can
be also used to prove the same results for s 7? P?,?(s).
Let ? = (?1, · · · , ?d) be a function defined on Sl taking values in Rd.
For s = (s1, · · · , sd) ? Rd, we consider the following transfer operator.
Ls?(a) =
?
j?S
e<s,?>?(Ta, j), a ? Sl-1,
Ai-Hua FAN, Jo¨rg SCHMELING and Meng WU 57
where <·, ·> denotes the scalar product in Rd. We denote the associated
pressure function by P (?)(s). Then, by the above discussion, for any
vectors u, v ? Rd the function
R ? s 7-? P (?)(us+ v)
is analytical and convex. We deduce from this that the function
s 7-? P (?)(s)
is infinitely differentiable and convex on Rd. We can prove that P (?)(s)
is indeed analytical by the same argument used to prove the analyticity
of P?(s).
Similarly, we define the level sets E(a) (a ? Rd) of ?. A vector
version of Theorem 1.1 is stated by just replacing the derivative of the
pressure function by gradient.
We finish the paper with two problems.
Subshifts of finite type. Our study is strictly restricted to the full
shift dynamics. It is a challenging problem to study the dynamics of
subshift of finite type.
More general are dynamics with Markov property. More efforts are
needed to deal with ß-shift which are not Markovian. New ideas are
needed to deal with these dynamics.
Nonlinear cookie cutter. The full shift is essentially the doubling
dynamics Tx = 2x mod 1 on the interval [0, 1). Cookie cutters are
the first interval maps coming into the mind after the doubling map.
If the cookie cutter maps are not linear, it is a difficult problem.
Based on the computation made in [22], Liao and Rams [21] con-
sidered a special piecewise linear map of two branches defined on two
intervals I0 and I1 and studied the following limit
lim
n?8
1
n
n?
k=1
1I1(T
kx)1I1(T
2kx).
The techniques presented in the present paper can be used to treat the
problem for general piecewise linear cookie cutter dynamics [12, 25].
